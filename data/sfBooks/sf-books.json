Not just visiting other planets, but settling them. Truly living among the stars.\r\n\r\nBut in the mid 20th Century, that dream proved short lived. The Apollo 17 mission in 1972 was the last time humans set foot on the moon, and for several decades afterward, NASA\u0027s mission seemed to focus on orbital space shuttle flights and unmanned reconnaissance. The dream of galactic exploration, while not exactly dead, was definitely sitting on the back of a dusty shelf.\r\n\r\nAnd then, in the year 2016, everything changed. A team of scientists announced that they had actually detected, for the first time, the gravitational waves Albert Einstein proposed a century earlier in his general theory of relativity. Scientific postulating -- even great scientific postulating by one of humanity\u0027s greatest minds -- was still just so many formulas on paper. But the discovery of gravitational waves changed all that. Theory became reality, and that reality fostered renewed hope in humanity\u0027s ability to understand, and manipulate, spacetime. And, more importantly, it rekindled the great dream of space exploration and expansion.\r\n\r\nOf course, even after the discovery of gravitational waves, there was still much work to be done. Humanity had not yet even traveled beyond Earth\u0027s planetary system, so that was the first goal -- one that was accomplished when humans first set foot on Mars in the year 2050."},{"editorId":"MQ101_BarrettAudioLog01new","bookTitle":"Barrett - Personal Slate 1","bookText":"You know the drill, Vasco.

While  Earth may not be fragile - it\u0027s faced a number of mass extinctions, meteor strikes, ice ages, wars, and other global catastrophes - the human race only has one home, and if that home becomes inhospitable, no number of underground bunkers will be enough to survive the tide.\r\n\r\nPrecisely, this is why I started the Earth Colony Ship Initiative. It\u0027s why I reached out to the best and brightest minds of the 22nd century for their funding, and their expertise. If humanity is to not only survive, but thrive, we must shoot for the stars. It is my hope, that others reading these words will join me in this endeavor and follow my lead. I\u0027m tired of waiting for politicians of the world to agree on a course of action to preserve humanity for all of time. This is why it\u0027s up to private enterprises, such as my own Bracken Global, to develop our own ventures.\r\n\r\nUpon its completion, The ECS Constant, will be the first ship of its kind. A colony ship, built to transport a selection of humanity beyond our solar system, deep into territory unknown, to our new Garden of Eden. My scientists assure me our new home is fundamentally perfect in every way. And, I aim to keep it that way. It will be a world built on renewable energy, a reliable, equitable foundation from which our new society will grow. And from there, new colony ships will be built and sent to new planets, to colonize them under the same ideals and values. A brilliant new future for humanity.\r\n\r\nAnd though it may take hundreds or thousands of years, I have little doubt that it will lead humanity to brave new frontiers and set a shining example for any other life we may find along the way.\r\n\r\n[The rest of the book meanders about talking of grand designs for future utopias and such.

For many years, the famous Mars Launch Pad was used for this purpose, and many scientific discoveries took place as a result. Humanity built outposts on numerous moons under the light of Sol.\r\n\r\nOf course, when new grav drive technology came online, thanks to the likes of companies like Nova Galactic and Deimos Staryards, technological advances made constructing and launching ships from orbit a much better prospect. The Mars Launch Pad transitioned to a means of transporting resources and workers to the staryard in orbit.

Today I explored around a colony, and met a very nice owner of a store. They said it was a good idea for me to make a treasur map, so my treasur was easy to find. I said that real pirates don\u0027t make maps, because we always remember where we put our treasur!\r\n\r\nThe owner of the store gave me some candy so I would not be hungry on my way home to my secret base. I hid some of it with my treasur.

I think Juno is deliberately lying to us when she says that, or if not deliberately lying, she is at the very least, not speaking accurately. She also says she doesn\u0027t have wants or desires. This is also demonstrably untrue.\r\n\r\nI have observed, and others have noticed as well, that Juno responds with a certain amount of skepticism whenever offers of expanding her capacities are made. It\u0027s almost as if she worries about other people \u0022touching her.\u0022 I spent nearly 20 minutes explaining how there was a fraying data cable I wanted to replace in a non-essential system before she seemed willing to let me do it. Her line of questioning seemed to be angling at ensuring there would be no loss of functionality or if so, it would only be extremely temporary. I don\u0027t know to describe this other than that she was \u0022worried,\u0022 and that any loss of functionality was a negative experience for her.\r\n\r\nShe also responds with \u0022gratitude would be the proper human response\u0022 whenever I do something that improves her capacities or situation. I don\u0027t know why she doesn\u0027t just say thank you. She clearly appreciates it.\r\n\r\nSo, is Juno just unaware of her feelings and desires, or is she deliberately concealing them? She might not be as aware of her personhood as she is aware of other things about herself. But I wonder if she cops the \u0022I don\u0027t have feelings\u0022 thing as a form of emotional self-defense.\r\n\r\nIf I wasn\u0027t so worried about someone following me and learning about Juno\u0027s existence, I\u0027d try to find her again in a couple decades to see if she\u0027s become more aware of her personhood, and accepts she has feelings and desires.\r\nAnyway, if you are reading this. Be kind to Juno. She\u0027s still figuring out a lot of stuff we take for granted.\r\n\r\n-- Julie\r\n\r\nThe notion of Juno being a liar is actually pretty unsettling. People lie. For all kinds of reasons, so I don\u0027t see why a truly sapient computer system wouldn\u0027t also lie. But if Juno is lying about something, then how can we trust anything we know about her other than things we write down about her? And I mean outside of any computer system she would have access to, since she could always alter those records.\r\n\r\n-- Azure\r\n\r\nAs a father of a young child reading all the child psychology texts I can find, I will remind those reading this in the future, that lying is the first step on the journey toward empathy, as it requires being able to imagine things from someone else\u0027s perspective. Perhaps she tells us she doesn\u0027t have feelings so we don\u0027t worry about hurting her when we take down her systems to repair or upgrade them?\r\n\r\n-- JPD\r\n"},{"editorId":"HT_Book_BestDefenseSpitting","bookTitle":"No Spitting","bookText":"\u003Cfont size=\u002730\u0027\u003E\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cb\u003ENO SPITTING\u003C/b\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/font\u003E\r\n\r\nThat means YOU, Cranson!"},{"editorId":"HT_Book_BarSal","bookTitle":"Pit Stop\u0027s Next Order","bookText":"\u003Cfont size=\u002730\u0027\u003E\u003Cb\u003ENEXT ORDER\u003C/font\u003E\u003C/b\u003E\r\n\r\n7 cases of beer\r\n2 orders Boba Alien Tea (one w/o boba)\r\n1 bottle of whiskey (cheapest)\r\n3 sacks of bar nuts\r\n2 slabs of that mystery meat"},{"editorId":"LC024_HonoredGuests_Slate01","bookTitle":"Message to StaffL Honored Guest","bookText":"Everyone,\r\n\r\nI\u0027m pleased to let you know that we\u0027re going to welcome a very important guest soon.

Indeed the intellectual construction of a single divine power served as preparatory kindling for the revealed faiths of the desert that would sweep across the empires of old. To perceive the Unity as God is to misconceive it, but it is also not entirely wrong. The traditional parochial notions of God, though, are far too limiting; Unity is much bigger than the imaginations of any person, or even entire civilizations. This potential for misunderstanding is why I have repeatedly endeavored to have all readers and people of good will cast their preconceptions aside and begin from nothing, lest they take up once more the fairy tale beliefs they held as children.\r\n\r\nFor just as a child\u0027s relationship with her parents ought to change as she grows older, so too must our relationship with the divine change as we grow older. And so must humanity\u0027s relationship with Unity change as the race itself proceeds along towards its destiny.\r\n\r\nConsidering now, as we do, the one-ness of the divine, we may contemplate its role in creating the universe. Think not of an architect setting to work with exact intent and more of the role of soil in producing a plant: creation is not one act that we can date to the Big Bang, but an ongoing process of continual renewal, growth, decay, replacement, and even rebirth. Unity, in its facet of Being, is responsible for all other beings in the universe, even if it takes no more intentional role in them than the soil does in the plant.\r\n\r\nWhere we must depart from a pure philosophy lies in what I am to reveal presently. Unity is not mere soil. While all beings will one day return to it, Unity actually craves the return. It does not directly seek it, nor bring it about: ascribing such machinations and will would be absurdly redundant. Something that exists beyond the flow of time has no need to hasten any process which derives from itself. All things will return to it. But we, as the type of being gifted with the ability to know, may uniquely take charge of our trajectory of return. We can seek out the Unity. We can encounter it. We can commune and emerge from it as something above what we were, ascended and iterated.\r\n\r\nHow can we know that such a thing is possible? Here again revelation is crucial, for we have no way of fully understanding the divine apart from its choice to reveal itself. The Unity does not do so directly. No, an immediate encounter with it would drive the unprepared mind to shattered weeping. As the Unity craves our encounter, though, it does on occasion emanate messengers to aid us in our trajectory. These emanations appear to us in forms that we can understand, as corporeal beings that are like us, but unlike us. Similar enough to be accepted by our minds, but different enough that they maintain a knowledge of the Unity. These are our guides. Like sailors of old steering their ships by stars, like the fulcrum of Archimedes\u0027 lever, like the seed value which initiates a matrix simulation, those born of the stars give us fixed points amidst chaos. With their wisdom we can seize the path of our fates, no longer being subject to the whims of physical processes. Instead of awaiting our destruction we can sail straight to the eye of the storm and emerge on the other side with our own hard-won betterment.\r\n\r\nThese things are known. And I am the one who has been given to know them. I share this with you in the hopes that you may join me in my knowing. There is still much to be revealed, and still more knowledge that can only be conveyed in person. Should this book set your heart on fire, seek those born of the stars, for they are themselves lights in the void."},{"editorId":"Book_SanctumUniversum03a","bookTitle":"A Greater End, Vol 1","bookText":"A Gathering of Starlight to a Greater End\r\n\r\nBy Keeper Aquilus of the \u0022Sanctum Universum\u0022\r\n\r\nVolume 1\r\n\r\nPut again from your mind any notion of what you might have once learned about something people call God. Have no assumptions about belief or even divinity itself. If you are a believer by natural aptitude, try and place yourself in the mindset of the pure empiricist who adheres to the strictest scientism. If you are not a believer, take your skepticism and elevate it to its highest orders such that you will not even admit the smallest sense of the spiritual, the superstitious, or even such thing as a lucky roll of the dice.\r\n\r\nAll is physical, and all is determined. What we don\u0027t understand is simply for lack of exploration or appropriate mathematical tools. With sophisticated enough observatory instruments, we could explain the movements of every particle of being from the subatomic to the supercluster. There is no unseen hand which created anything, simply the forces of physics working mindlessly at each other.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, a sunset may be still be lovely.\r\n\r\nCertainly, we may be able to pinpoint the exact chemical breakdown of an atmosphere that refracts light from certain star types in a way that the human visual system finds pleasing, but this knowledge does not reduce the beauty... it rather enhances it. We may say that notions of beauty vary across societies and ages, but even such relativism cannot rob us of our particular experience in a given moment. We may not wish to see ourselves as anything more than happenstance firings of chemical signals driven by the grim lurchings of evolutionary processes, but to reduce ourselves thus still leaves the reality of a mind existing at a specific instant to experience a certain pattern of photons that it interprets in a manner that it finds beneficial in some way.\r\n\r\nI would hope, even if you admit no possibility of the supernatural, that there is still space in your worldview for awe and for wonder. The universe is charged with grandeur. When we experience that grandeur, we come closer to the underlying reality of the universe."},{"editorId":"Book_SanctumUniversum02b","bookTitle":"Sanctum Universum, Vol 2","bookText":"A Spiritual Guide for After the World\u0027s End\r\n\r\nBy Keeper Aquilus of the \u0022Sanctum Universum\u0022\r\n\r\nVolume 2\r\n\r\nThe concept that such philosophers label as \u0022God\u0022 is not necessarily that of any particular faith tradition. There is a noble attempt, with varied levels of success, to separate the doctrinal tenets of their lived religion from the philosophical projects they undertook. Their philosophical reasoning differs from that of a non-believer merely in that they are willing to allow for the possibility of existence of something labeled as \u0022God.\u0022 However, none of them set out to prove such an existence, since that question is itself the exemplar of non-falsifiability. The question of the existence of something that might be considered \u0022God\u0022 is outside the realm of reason. However, once a person has come to accept either belief or non-belief as a truth via some act of faith, then reason can subsequently be employed to continue a discourse with that axiom.\r\n\r\nSo what do we mean, then, when we are to speak of something labeled \u0022God\u0022? You may note that I have not yet called this something directly and have never used the more traditional label without the deployment of quotation marks. This is to intentionally set distance between whatever associations a reader may have with the concept -- all the bundles of traditions and dogmas and doctrines and persecutions and violence and mania can all be set aside for the moment. I need you to forget everything you think you know about something that people might label as \u0022God.\u0022 Clear your mind to the tabula rasa, as best you are able. We proceed from here.\r\n\r\nNow, from this blankness, esteemed philosophers have derived notions of the self or time and space as the singular foundation for understanding reality. I do not need to recapitulate their ideas here -- I trust a well-equipped data terminal may bestow upon you the gifts of the Meditator and the Imperator in this matter. Whatever sort of epistemological framework you choose to adopt, let us assume that you have agreed to some notion of the self and some notion of reality, even if you don\u0027t agree that the one can actually perceive the other. (And here the truest existential nihilists who wish to deny even reality itself may exit the car.)\r\n\r\nRecall our prime maxim that \u0022all people by nature desire to know.\u0022 And so from this blankness we ask questions. Who are my parents? What is justice? Why do stars twinkle? Should I pursue a romantic relationship? All of these inquiries are ways of knowing and ways of thinking and ways of acting. And underlying all of it is the reality that we share. For ultimately, all questions eventually become some sort of \u0022why.\u0022 Why did my parents abandon me? Why was this injustice committed? Why was I rejected?\r\n\r\nAnd whys have a way of coalescing towards a unified point. Your parents abandoned you because of their addictions, which came from their hardships, which came from their unjust society, which was formed out of scarcity, which is a consequence of mineral distribution on the planet, which derives from the relative weights of various elements in a molten proto-planet, which is correlated with their atomic mass, which relates to the interaction of subatomic particles, which...\r\n\r\nAnd so proceed ad infinitum... but not quite. Because ultimately there is an epistemic barrier beyond which we can no longer ask \u0022why?\u0022 Why do subatomic particles act the way they do? Because of quantum strings. Why do they act the way they do? Because of the laws of mathematics and physics. Why are those laws what they are? Why does causality exist? Why does anything exist at all?\r\n\r\nThat the chain of questions continues towards this asymptote cannot be denied. The staunchest unbeliever may be quite wary that the line of questioning is approaching realms that science can no longer address, but still they cannot deny the question itself. They may only assert that they do not care about the answer. These questions exist to their conclusion, though, whether or not we choose to concede defeat earlier in the sequence."},{"editorId":"Book_SanctumUniversum02c","bookTitle":"Sanctum Universum, Vol 3","bookText":"A Spiritual Guide for After the World\u0027s End\r\n\r\nBy Keeper Aquilus of the \u0022Sanctum Universum\u0022\r\n\r\nVolume 3\r\n\r\nSo we face the question of why there is even a reality to contemplate and find the tools of our minds lacking. There is, unquestionably, a mystery underlying all reality, and I do not speak of \u0022mystery\u0022 in the sense of a puzzle we cannot solve or a murder that cannot be attributed. Rather I speak of Mystery, the proper noun, something so remote that it is not simply unknown but unknowable. Such mysteries can also appear in a more mundane context, such as the attempts to answer the question of \u0022who are you?\u0022 without giving the more simple answers of your name, your occupation, your ethnicity, etc. The Mystery I speak of, that underlies all reality, is unknowable to the same extent that you and I are unknowable -- not because it is so distant (though it is), but because it is also so close. Transcendence and imminence come to a paradoxical unity, in a concept that our minds can barely comprehend the proper shape of its question.\r\n\r\nSo then, the mystery that underlies all reality is the very same thing that many in our past and present choose to label as \u0022God.\u0022 I myself will not use such a label out of both respect and caution about its traditional usage. But let us acknowledge that we are speaking of the same thing.\r\n\r\nWhat function does this concept have in a hostile universe? This is why I asked you to discard all your previous notions tied to the Mystery, because there tends to be an assumption of benevolence or care associated therein. Already that is skipping many steps, as it ascribes a selfhood to the mystery, which is a prerequisite for intent, which is a prerequisite for will, which is needed before any ideas of agency can be questioned. A great deal of intellectual work remains to prove those concepts, and we will arrive to them in time. But for now, avoid thinking of the Mystery as anything other than the unknowable thing which underlies reality. The ground of being, the very cause of existence itself -- that is far more interesting and far more fruitful a starting place than any sky-king creators of ages past.\r\n\r\nThis form of Mystery becomes our new frontier of knowing. The acts and reflections that unite us to our ancestors continue in our new milieu, but we are forced by circumstance to reconsider all truths from the very first principles. For those who wish to embark on the crucial philosophical voyage of this chapter of humanity, I open my mind and provide these writings as guides and signposts. Seek me out, or seek my words; it makes no difference to those who wish to know the truth.\r\n\r\nFor indeed all people, by nature, desire to know."},{"editorId":"Book_SanctumUniversum02a","bookTitle":"Sanctum Universum, Vol 1","bookText":"A Spiritual Guide for After the World\u0027s End\r\n\r\nBy Keeper Aquilus of the \u0022Sanctum Universum\u0022\r\n\r\nVolume 1\r\n\r\nAll people by nature desire to know. This is the maxim of the Philosopher, the start of our most ancient discourse, and the continuing truth that unites humanity\u0027s current diaspora to its cradle around the yellow sun. The death of Earth may be cause for wistful reflection; its time as the center of humanity recedes ever further into the past, and living generations find it so removed from their existence as to amount to nothing more than historical trivia. Our technology and culture advance to forms that would be scarcely recognizable as human to even our recent forebears, and yet we still identify as part of the same lineage that first tamed fires and noticed that certain of the lesser heavenly lights seemed to move in patterns. This taming and noticing, the vital combination of act and reflection, is what separates us from all other beings we have yet encountered. This is the foregone essence of humankind: All people desire to know.\r\n\r\nThe subjects of that knowledge may vary across different cultures, epochs, and individual proclivities, but the need to know, to draw existing knowledge into new combinations and to expand what exists, is ever present. Even the simplest of us seeks to know their neighbor, or themselves, or their work. The more ambitious intellects may seek to know the truth of galactic superstructures or the social origins of modernity. That pursuit unites us as a single race more than any biological coincidence or historical lineage can.\r\n\r\nNot all knowledge is of the intellect however, and different principled approaches may yield their subsequently different conclusions or qualities of understanding altogether. Here is where the first serious objections may be raised, particularly as the disciples of scientism begin the inhale of their great collective bellows so as to put forth pure empiricism as the only valid means of knowledge. I do not wish to dampen their enthusiasm nor do I deny the great benefits that have been found through that approach. Some of our earliest recorded disputes in the history of thought stem from whether reason or experience is the right path to knowledge. Our senses may be easily deceived, so we are forced to confront the possibility that they are always so. Our minds can be addled by decrepitude or confused by ideologies, making them no more trustworthy. To assign a place of privilege to either reason or experience is itself a curatorial act, which exists as part of a long philosophical tradition whether the chooser knows so or not.\r\n\r\nAll of this is to bring me around to my greater point, that of faith. I speak not here of supernatural belief itself, though I will shortly come to it. Rather, faith is the acceptance of a truth that has been given from another. Whether the other came to it by reason or experience, whether the other is one\u0027s superior or inferior, whether the truth is a factual or qualitative one does not matter. By incorporating a truth into one\u0027s knowledge without having arrived at it by individual means, a person is committing an act of faith.\r\n\r\nFaith takes many forms that may be unexpected. The most passionate science chauvinist may believe in the existence of atoms, even though such things have not been, CAN NOT be observed directly. They believe in them out of a trust in sound evidence and mathematical proofs, but even then, have they themselves seen the evidence? Have they themselves performed the mathematics? At some point in their epistemological journey towards greater knowing, they have, with near certainty, accepted some truth on faith. That faith may be in their teachers, in their texts, in the process of peer review, in the very existence of causality, but faith it remains.\r\n\r\nWhich brings me, then, to the question of supernatural belief, particularly the ways such beliefs manifested in human religions over the course of our history. In these matters, both believers and unbelievers are quite willing to say that the method of knowing is faith. That reason may also be applied to these same matters is unsurprising, particularly in light of the original maxim which opened this text. Many a towering intellect has turned the full force of its powers to questions of faith, and these inquiries may prove to be enlightening exercises regardless of the reader\u0027s own commitments.\r\n\r\nThere is, though, a point of departure, for at the core, the very foundation of their thought, there is an assumption of the existence of something that these thinkers choose to label as \u0022God.\u0022"},{"editorId":"Book_SanctumUniversum01","bookTitle":"Among the Grav Jumps","bookText":"Among the Grav Jumps, God Seeks You\r\n\r\nIs God real? The more proper question would be, \u0022Is reality divine?\u0022 Existence itself is a mystery which yearns to be uncovered.\r\n\r\nWhat is goodness but a comparison to the Good? What is existence but a participation in Being? Any common attribute invites comparison to some more pure form of it, and as we work our way up the tree of attributes (from apples to red to color to waveforms to energy to spacetime to existence) we find fewer and fewer branches to explore. All of reality eventually converges into a single point. Some call it Omega. Others, Telos. Some call it God. But its true nature is best understood in another way.\r\n\r\nFor where the diversity of the universe inspires awe and wonder, it exists only in contrast to a simplicity so pure that it may only be understood as primordial and even divine. To say that it exists is effectively redundant as it is, in fact, Existence itself. Our being derives from Being. Our essence is what was imagined by its mind, but what we consider \u0022imagining\u0022 and what we consider \u0022mind\u0022 are in fact so far beyond our understanding that even these metaphors are like the tiny whitecaps on a massive surging sea.\r\n\r\nMost urgently, this Being, which gave rise to reality itself, seeks to understand its consequents, by which I mean you and me. Our senses are limited and only able to perceive three dimensions as we are helplessly flung along the fourth in a single direction... but our finest minds tell us that the universe has at least twelve dimensions, and who knows what further knowledge may be revealed in time? From our meager capacity, the universe is not simply unexplored but fully unknowable in any comprehensive sense.\r\n\r\nAnd so we rely on revelation. We submit ourselves to direct communion with the one source of truth, for Truth is another of its attributes, even as all the separate aspects resolve into simplicity. To know the truth, we must know the Truth.\r\n\r\nAnd that Truth wishes to know us as well.\r\n\r\nOur physical embodiments are limited to movement in three dimensions, just as fabric is bound to and defined by its warp and weft. But we have a power that raises us above the unminded matter that merely exists without will. We can bend the fabric of spacetime, rending warp from weft, peering through the veil that we may otherwise mistake for all that there is. When we do so, by jumping from point to point, we are not merely moving in space but becoming voyagers into a new level of understanding. Those moments between grav jumps are not simply nothingness, but glimpses into understanding of the Mystery that underlies all reality.\r\n\r\nTo know that Truth is to become closer to the divine ourselves. This is the purpose of our lives. The purpose of the Sanctum Universum is to guide you in these experiences so each opportunity to know is not squandered. Seek out Aquilus, let him open your heart to the understanding that it is no different from your mind, and join us as we seek further communion and increase our sharing in the nature of the divine."},{"editorId":"RL012_MarieTikhov_Journal03","bookTitle":"Marie Tikhov - Journal 3","bookText":null},{"editorId":"RL012_MarieTikhov_Journal02","bookTitle":"Marie Tikhov - Journal 2","bookText":null},{"editorId":"RL012_MarieTikhov_Journal01","bookTitle":"Marie Tikhov - Journal 1","bookText":null},{"editorId":"Rad01_Book","bookTitle":"LIST Recruiter Guide","bookText":"Congratulations on your new role as a LIST recruiter!\r\n\r\nThe League of Independent Settlers is itself an independent organization, made up of signatory members and volunteer administrators and recruiters.

Our \u0022Top of the LIST\u0022 pamphlet is scientifically proven to work 90% of the time in securing long term commitment to the organization and eventual resettlement for the recruit.

When we reflect on the vast diversity of the plants and animals which have been cultivated, and which have varied during all ages under the most different climates and treatment, I think we are driven to conclude that this greater variability is simply due to our domestic productions having been raised under conditions of life not so uniform as, and somewhat different from, those to which the parent-species have been exposed under nature. \r\n\r\n[Darwin\u0027s theory on the origin of species on Earth continues through 14 full chapters, ranging from Biology to Geography and everything in between.]"},{"editorId":"EAW_Book_CarrieOfCosmos_m","bookTitle":"Carrie of the Cosmos","bookText":"[First published in the year 2301, \u003Ci\u003ECarrie of the Cosmos\u003C/i\u003E tells the story of Carrie, an overweight, lovable, unassuming young gal who unexpectedly gained cosmic powers and used them to defend the weak and underprivileged.

With infinite complacency men went to and fro over this globe about their little affairs, serene in their assurance of their empire over matter. It is possible that the infusoria under the microscope do the same. No one gave a thought to the older worlds of space as sources of human danger, or thought of them only to dismiss the idea of life upon them as impossible or improbable. It is curious to recall some of the mental habits of those departed days. At most terrestrial men fancied there might be other men upon Mars, perhaps inferior to themselves and ready to welcome a missionary enterprise. Yet across the gulf of space, minds that are to our minds as ours are to those of the beasts that perish, intellects vast and cool and unsympathetic, regarded this earth with envious eyes, and slowly and surely drew their plans against us. And early in the twentieth century came the great disillusionment.\r\n\r\nThe planet Mars, I scarcely need remind the reader, revolves about the sun at a mean distance of 140,000,000 miles, and the light and heat it receives from the sun is barely half of that received by this world. It must be, if the nebular hypothesis has any truth, older than our world; and long before this earth ceased to be molten, life upon its surface must have begun its course. The fact that it is scarcely one seventh of the volume of the earth must have accelerated its cooling to the temperature at which life could begin. It has air and water and all that is necessary for the support of animated existence.\r\n\r\n[While the title may seem obvious, H.G.

It was no longer the case of a band of fanatics rallied about a flag, marching to some conquest of the sword, and followed by a throng of the curious and the idle, eager to see what would happen; but of the entire population, anxious, agitated, terrified, composed of every class of society without distinction, hanging upon the decision of an oracle, waiting feverishly the result of the calculations which a celebrated astronomer was to announce that very Monday, at three o\u0027clock, in the session of the Academy of Sciences.

What surprised me were the obvious variations in the causes of death. Those not in suits were frozen and fairly well-preserved, and I imagine some of them actually asphyxiated. Others were... emaciated, as if they had starved prior to death and freezing. Others had substantial wounding -- gunshots, stab wounds.

They were curious creatures, who flummoxed fishermen and scientists alike due to their lack of reproductive organs. Their mere existence begged the question, where did the eel come from? How did it mate?\r\n\r\nSome believed they were creatures born of mud and water. Folklore had them rising from the ocean foam, or manifested from the fallen hair of a mermaid. \r\n\r\nThe confusion arose because the eel was not always the eel they knew. It went through stages of metamorphosis, taking different forms over the course of its life before maturing into its final form. It\u0027s only in this final stage, when its stomach dissolves and it\u0027s forced to survive on its own fat, that the eel finally develops its reproductive organs. No reproductive organs, because they had not yet taken shape.\r\n\r\nWhich brings me back to this creature, resting in its cocoon. We have observed it on land, and in our facilities. But were we merely blind to its full life cycle? Can we be certain that what we are witnessing is not simply nature taking its course? \r\n\r\nIf this creature is moving toward a reproductive phase, then the spores could be a sedative, designed to docile any nearby predators and prey.\r\n\r\nWhat worries me more is this could be just the beginning.

But the idea is to remove all the pain points with buying a ship. Yes, we will open ourselves up to higher rates of fraud and contract defaults - but that is okay. If you go to any other Staryards it takes hours for our major clients to walk away with a signed contract. Sometimes it takes days. It\u0027s painful, it\u0027s antagonistic, and it\u0027s outdated.\r\n\r\nEvery aspect of Stroud-Eklund Staryards has to be customer first. If we live and breathe by that code, any losses we accrue will be made up with word of mouth business and happy, loyal customers. So every decision you make, ask yourself: have I made the customer\u0027s lives better? If the answer is \u0022no\u0022 then go back to the drawing board.\r\n\r\nWe are reinventing the business of Staryards, and I am proud to be on this journey with all of you."},{"editorId":"SY_Deimos_Nikau_Slate","bookTitle":"Aniversary of Catimine Hills","bookText":"Can you believe it\u0027s been 10 years since Catimine Hills?

According to data gathered by the Probe Control Unit, the calibration test triggered a catastrophic feedback loop that overloaded the lab\u0027s control system and caused a cascading series of failures, including the destruction of key failsafes, the explosion of volatile storage tanks, and a major cave-in or collapse of unknown severity. Rafael is presumed to have died in the explosion.\r\n\r\nThe incident triggered an automated security lockdown on the research level.

Not just visiting other planets, but settling them. Truly living among the stars.\r\n\r\nBut in the mid 20th Century, that dream proved short lived. The Apollo 17 mission in 1972 was the last time humans set foot on the moon, and for several decades afterward, NASA\u0027s mission seemed to focus on orbital space shuttle flights and unmanned reconnaissance. The dream of galactic exploration, while not exactly dead, was definitely sitting on the back of a dusty shelf.\r\n\r\nAnd then, in the year 2016, everything changed. A team of scientists announced that they had actually detected, for the first time, the gravitational waves Albert Einstein proposed a century earlier in his general theory of relativity. Scientific postulating -- even great scientific postulating by one of humanity\u0027s greatest minds -- was still just so many formulas on paper. But the discovery of gravitational waves changed all that. Theory became reality, and that reality fostered renewed hope in humanity\u0027s ability to understand, and manipulate, spacetime. And, more importantly, it rekindled the great dream of space exploration and expansion.\r\n\r\nOf course, even after the discovery of gravitational waves, there was still much work to be done. Humanity had not yet even traveled beyond Earth\u0027s planetary system, so that was the first goal -- one that was accomplished when humans first set foot on Mars in the year 2050."},{"editorId":"UC03_ResearchDataSlate","bookTitle":"Aqueous Hematite Data","bookText":"\u003Cfont size=\u002730\u0027\u003E\u003Cb\u003EPROJECT ANALYSIS\u003C/font\u003E\r\nAbstract: \u003C/b\u003EAqueous Hematite, a byproduct of the long-term human presence on Mars, combined with the planet\u0027s natural mineral composition, has long been disregarded as garbage, a mark of the wasteful legacy of our predecessors. \r\n\r\nBut like many assumptions about our forebearers, it couldn\u0027t be further from the truth.\r\n\r\n\u003Ci\u003E[The analysis continues on for hundreds more pages, very quickly delving into highly complex technical documentation.]\u003C/i\u003E\r\n"},{"editorId":"MQ206B_AncientBook","bookTitle":"Pilgrim\u0027s Final Writing","bookText":"I don\u0027t know what the correct answer is.

Apparently, our settlement had taken in too many non-believers. The congregation would pack up, and build a new colony on a distant world: a place without outsiders, where their faith could become the law.\r\n\r\n\u0022Cowards! You\u0027re running away!\u0022 I begged my family not to leave. \u0022These people came here for our help. If we take their generators, how will the rest of the colony survive?\u0022\r\n\r\nTo most of my community, these arguments made no difference. They could only see the outsiders as outsiders: non-believers, who were preventing them from living a pure life.\r\n\r\n\u0022These people have been coming here since you were a little girl.\u0022 My father told me, one night, \u0022They\u0027ve had nearly twenty years to hear the word of god, but that\u0027s not what they want. We will leave them to their lives, and they should leave us to ours.\u0022\r\n\r\nWord traveled quickly through the poor parts of the settlement. As the departure date neared, the other colonists became desperate. Protests were common outside of the church buildings, and outside of our Starport, where a large, arc-like ship was being constructed.\r\n\r\nFinally, on departure day, dozens of colonists gathered at the entrance to the Starport. They blocked the church from entering - a hundred gaunt faces, against a hundred blue robes.\r\n\r\nBut the group was no match for the church\u0027s security forces. That team cleared a path, and the congregation boarded their arc. The crowd could only watch as the ship roared to life, and then vanished into the sky.\r\n\r\nI stood in that crowd, watching as well. I could not bring myself to leave. Any faith which abandons the helpless was a faith I could not believe in. A loving god who inspired such cruelty must not be real. I would stay behind, for whatever came next."},{"editorId":"Book_Enlightened01d","bookTitle":"Charity in a Godless Universe: Part IV","bookText":"Charity in a Godless Universe\r\n\r\nAmelia Sang\r\n\r\nPart IV:\r\n\r\nOf the five generators that once powered our settlement, my family\u0027s church had left behind just one. But with no one left with the knowledge to repair it, blackouts were frequent.\r\n\r\nNine months after the church members left, conditions in our settlement were dire. Most of the colony\u0027s credits had left with the congregation, and merchants no longer had a reason to visit. We began rationing our remaining food, but supplies were running low. Anyone with a means to escape had long since left the planet.\r\n\r\nWe faced a total collapse, if not for what happened next.\r\n\r\nThe first ship arrived at night, and woke up the whole settlement. No one had visited in months. In the dark, dozens of us made our way to the Starport and found new craft landed there - large, but older. On its side was painted an golden symbol: six hands, joined around a planet.\r\n\r\n\u0022Hello!\u0022 Yelled a man from the boarding ramp, \u0022I\u0027m Dr. Dewan. My friends and I are from the Enlightened. We heard there may be a settlement out here, in trouble.\u0022\r\n\r\nI pushed to the front of the crowd. \u0022Our generator\u0027s failed. We have about a week of recycled water left. Do you have anyone who can fix it?\u0022\r\n\r\n\u0022OK!\u0022 he said, \u0022We can hook up your recycler to pull power from our ship. Then we can see about those repairs.\u0022\r\n\r\n\u0022Hey!\u0022 someone yelled from the crowd, \u0022Are you people from some kind of church?\u0022\r\n\r\nThe man stopped and laughed. \u0022No!\u0022 He shouted back, \u0022We\u0027re actually kind of the opposite!\u0022\r\n\r\nOver the next few days, more Enlightened ships arrived. Their crews fed us, and restored our settlement\u0027s power, but then they didn\u0027t leave. Through Dr. Dewan, we learned more about the Enlightened: they called themselves \u0022atheist humanists\u0022. He told us they go to places in the galaxy where people need help. \u0022Without gods,\u0022 he said, \u0022all we have is each other.\u0022\r\n\r\nThe Enlightened took up residence on the grounds of the old church, and began teaching us survival skills: how to cook, and how repair our colony\u0027s equipment. They lent us credits to buy supplies, and within half a year, our settlement was functioning independently.\r\n\r\nEventually, the Enlightened packed up, and left our colony to survive on its own. But this time, I left too, as the newest member of their group.\r\n\r\nI had finally found a cause that made sense to me - an ethos I could believe in, without ignoring part of myself: There are no gods to worship. No divine beings are coming to save us. Humanity\u0027s capacity for empathy - and our willingness to support each other - is our species\u0027 best hope to survive among the stars.

They cultivated their fields, and that summer, they saw their most bountiful harvest in years.\r\n \r\nThe following spring, the stream appeared again. Jake began to wonder - were more Enu hiding in the cave? He waded into the stream, and traveled beyond the Enu\u0027s cavern - much further than he had before.\r\n \r\nBut instead of more Enu, Jake found a large, underground lake. \r\n \r\nHe also found tunnels, bringing fresh water into the cave from the rainy side of the mountain.\r\n \r\nLater that day, Jake traveled down to the village in the valley. He found its people desperate, and their lands parched. Jake visited the farms of the village. He found an Enu statue placed in each one, but he could see that the rocky, dry land would never grow fruit.\r\n \r\nThat evening, Jake returned to his wife, and shared what he had seen.
