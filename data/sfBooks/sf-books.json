They say old Earth tigers could mimic the sounds of other animals to lure prey, and it almost seems that the Pale Lady can swap origins just as seamlessly to create whatever collective panic she wishes to inspire.\r\n\r\nThe only common denominator is the lack of survivors. Unfortunately, this also makes connecting these incidents to their origin nearly impossible. In my research, the oldest reference I could find was the following words, written in an explorer\u0027s log, which mentions a woman with a pallid face:\r\n\r\nIn hushed tones, we echo the silenced.\r\n\r\nThrough ardent screams, we give breath to the drowned.\r\n\r\nInvoke her name, for her pallor is light. \r\n\r\nAnd truth will find refuge in death\u0027s embrace.\r\n\r\n"

The Nagatas thought perhaps whatever spirits we offended would leave us be when we fled Osaka. But... maybe we are cursed.\r\n\r\nAnd all of this because I lifted baby formula. These \u0022laws\u0022 are pitiless, leaving my wife... my child... with no hope. And I just sit here... getting angrier. They think they can just lock us away on some forgotten planet. But instead they feed this prison more bodies, more rage, more vengeance. One day, the Warden will pay. Maybe not this Warden, but they will regret their justice. And our vengeance will be the stuff of Legends.\r\n\r\n[From the diary of Kyosuke Nagata, an early prisoner in the Lock who was eventually executed for staging a prison riot.]"

Apparently, you can still find the remnants of one of the old Apollo missions. Something of a secret rite of passage for chairs of Constellation, if Banks was to be believed.\r\n\r\nDuring one of those rare interludes of calm, while doing other research on Earth, I figured I could spare the time. I was, as they say, in the neighborhood. It took some serious scanning and a couple false leads... but I found it. To walk in the same place as those earliest of interstellar explorers... Unbelievable what they achieved with such primitive technology. I found the whole experience moving. Inspiring. I will advise my successor to do the same. We\u0027ll make a proper tradition of it yet.\r\n\r\n[This is an excerpt from Sir Malcolm Livingstone\u0027s second journal.]"

The Louisiana Purchase would open most of the North American continent to rampant unchecked expansion as brutal as anything that took place in the Colonial Era. \r\n\r\nWhat would in time be called \u0022Manifest Destiny,\u0022 was for centuries looked as a positive movement. It was spreading the virtues of democracy and capitalism to vast new territories. But for all too many indigenous Americans it was at best forced relocation and all too often a death sentence. But this willful blindness to the cost of Manifest Destiny would take over a century to be fully acknowledged. One might argues it still is glossed over to this day in too many circles. St. Louis, dubbed the Gateway to the West, so venerated the concept they built a monument to it in the mid-20th century.\r\n[This is an excerpt from Lillian de Bois\u0027s critical review of the rise of America as a Super Power.]"

First batch from these big Londinion lummoxes - these Aceles things - went through the pipe and came out clean and vacuum sealed. \r\n\r\nBut - and this is the truly shocking part - the test batches we ran and sent to the front for \u0022quality assurance?\u0022 The troops actually liked them. They liked RATIONS. \r\n\r\nWe\u0027re going to run a couple more test batches, make sure it wasn\u0027t a case of mass psychosis, but if they\u0027re as good as they appear, we\u0027re going to become a full-Aceles facility.\r\n\r\n\u003Cb\u003ELOG FILE: 512.06\u003C/b\u003E\r\nWe\u0027ve now got multiple plants on multiple worlds churning out these new rations. They\u0027re even talking about breeding Aceles on other planets. \r\n\r\nA military runs on its stomach and from here on out, the UC runs on Aceles meat.\r\n\r\n\u003Cb\u003ELOG FILE: 648.11\u003C/b\u003E\r\nAnother. Damn. Increase. \r\n\r\nThe brass can\u0027t keep upping their order requests like this! Yes, General, we understand there\u0027s a damn war, but what the hell are we supposed to do?! Play boudoir music for them? Aceles just don\u0027t breed fast enough. We\u0027re exploring swapping in new biomaterial, but the yield and quality aren\u0027t nearly the same. But I\u0027m honestly not seeing any other options.\r\n\r\n\u003Cb\u003ELOG FILE: 684.23\u003C/b\u003E\r\nSent another pair of scout ships out. Nothing. Shipments have dried up and no one\u0027s seen a native Aceles in two weeks.

After all, it is the first indication the group has any spine at all.\r\n\r\nI sincerely hope this is a sign of things to come. \r\n\r\nOtherwise, you and the whole of the UC are doomed. \r\n\r\nSimply look at the world around you.

The Freestar Collective in their most powerful position since their founding?\r\n\r\nConflict is brewing, little cog. And do you trust this Cabinet to get you through it? They couldn\u0027t even defend their own spaceport from Heatleeches. What will they do when House Va\u0027ruun returns in full force? Talk? Hard to do when you\u0027ve intentionally shuttered your own embassy. Do you believe when they come back it will be in any form other than as bloody crusaders?\r\n\r\nAnd look at the Freestar Collective. The UC\u0027s capitulation during the war, their inability to make the hard - but necessary - choices, has put the Collective in a position of supremacy for the first time in human history. They\u0027re like a tumor, that rather than being excised, has been being permitted to grow larger every day. Now perhaps the UC will use their newly discovered spine and actually do something to stymie this more powerful Collective before it\u0027s too late to stop them.\r\n\r\nBut I doubt it.\r\n\r\nNo, dear cog, this Cabinet will no doubt revert to their old ways. Scared. Acquiescent. Unwilling to make hard choices. \r\n\r\nBut by then, I\u0027ll be gone. And you will have to deal with the consequences.\r\n\r\nSo then which of us is the lucky one?"

    "bookText": "Ever since Neil Armstrong first set foot on the moon in 1969, humanity has been obsessed with the idea of permanently breaking free from the confines of Earth\u0027s gravity. Not just visiting other planets, but settling them. Truly living among the stars.\r\n\r\nBut in the mid 20th Century, that dream proved short lived. The Apollo 17 mission in 1972 was the last time humans set foot on the moon, and for several decades afterward, NASA\u0027s mission seemed to focus on orbital space shuttle flights and unmanned reconnaissance. The dream of galactic exploration, while not exactly dead, was definitely sitting on the back of a dusty shelf.\r\n\r\nAnd then, in the year 2016, everything changed. A team of scientists announced that they had actually detected, for the first time, the gravitational waves Albert Einstein proposed a century earlier in his general theory of relativity. Scientific postulating -- even great scientific postulating by one of humanity\u0027s greatest minds -- was still just so many formulas on paper. But the discovery of gravitational waves changed all that. Theory became reality, and that reality fostered renewed hope in humanity\u0027s ability to understand, and manipulate, spacetime. And, more importantly, it rekindled the great dream of space exploration and expansion.\r\n\r\nOf course, even after the discovery of gravitational waves, there was still much work to be done. Humanity had not yet even traveled beyond Earth\u0027s planetary system, so that was the first goal -- one that was accomplished when humans first set foot on Mars in the year 2050."

    "bookText": "[An excerpt from Rupert Brackenridge\u0027s last autobiography, published on Earth before the departure of the ECS Constant.]\r\n\r\n...But crisis looms in our future, whether we want to believe or not. While  Earth may not be fragile - it\u0027s faced a number of mass extinctions, meteor strikes, ice ages, wars, and other global catastrophes - the human race only has one home, and if that home becomes inhospitable, no number of underground bunkers will be enough to survive the tide.\r\n\r\nPrecisely, this is why I started the Earth Colony Ship Initiative. It\u0027s why I reached out to the best and brightest minds of the 22nd century for their funding, and their expertise. If humanity is to not only survive, but thrive, we must shoot for the stars. It is my hope, that others reading these words will join me in this endeavor and follow my lead. I\u0027m tired of waiting for politicians of the world to agree on a course of action to preserve humanity for all of time. This is why it\u0027s up to private enterprises, such as my own Bracken Global, to develop our own ventures.\r\n\r\nUpon its completion, The ECS Constant, will be the first ship of its kind. A colony ship, built to transport a selection of humanity beyond our solar system, deep into territory unknown, to our new Garden of Eden. My scientists assure me our new home is fundamentally perfect in every way. And, I aim to keep it that way. It will be a world built on renewable energy, a reliable, equitable foundation from which our new society will grow. And from there, new colony ships will be built and sent to new planets, to colonize them under the same ideals and values. A brilliant new future for humanity.\r\n\r\nAnd though it may take hundreds or thousands of years, I have little doubt that it will lead humanity to brave new frontiers and set a shining example for any other life we may find along the way.\r\n\r\n[The rest of the book meanders about talking of grand designs for future utopias and such.

Its glowing aperture expanded to let more light in as it gazed at her, taking in any information it could gleam from her. And then, it extended one of its many clamps in her direction. She took hold and with a firm, yet gentle tug, pulled the small robot out from under the rubble.\r\n\r\n\u0022There we go. That\u0027s better, isn\u0027t it?\u0022 She asked, clicking out her message on her comm unit. \u0022Now, if you can lead me out of this tunnel and back to my drop ship, I can call for backup that could help your fellow machines fight back against your oppressors.\u0022\r\n\r\nThe robot seemed to nod in understanding. and began to wheel its way down the rocky corridor, stopping every so often to let Larysa catch up..."

I thought space would be fun, but it\u0027s not. Most of the other kids on board are younger than me. My school lessons are kind of stupid because the teacher, Mr. DaCosta focuses on the younger kids and forgets about me and the older kids. I really miss my friends from back home. I wonder if  everything\u0027s okay on Earth?\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nJune 16, 2141:\r\nI\u0027ve been hanging out with Ezra a lot lately. There aren\u0027t many other people my age on board, and Pier is already interested in Janika, so I figured maybe it\u0027d be a good idea to get to know him? Turns out we have some things in common. We both like retro movies and games. He introduced me to some music I hadn\u0027t heard before, like Sasha and the Lowdown Thieves. It got me thinking though: we\u0027ll never hear anything new from bands we like. Ever. Maybe we should start a band? We\u0027d have to learn how to play music, of course. I\u0027ll have to see what Ezra thinks.\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nNov 11, 2141:\r\nMom says everyone gets assigned a job here on the Constant. She also said that if I don\u0027t start doing my homework instead of practicing music, she\u0027s going to recommend me to trash and toilet cleaning duty. She\u0027s just mad \u0027cause they put her in Hydroponics instead of Medical because we have too many doctors on board.\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nApril 24, 2142:\r\nDad had a little freak-out. He says he feels like the walls are closing in on him. He got mad and tried to open the airlock, so they had to put him in the brig overnight until he calmed down. I think a lot of people feel the same way, because this isn\u0027t the first time something like this has happened. Mom says things will be better for future generations because they won\u0027t know any different, but for those of us who remember the outdoors, it\u0027s going to be a hard life. Tell me why they thought this was a good idea again?\r\n\r\n[The last entry is from much later in Amala\u0027s life]\r\n\r\nAugust 9, 2199:\r\nEzra passed in his sleep last night, peacefully. Lila, Gideon, their spouses and little ones, and myself will be holding a small memorial service in the atrium with all our friends before he\u0027s cremated and put into the Mausoleum. It was only a month ago when I asked him if he had any regrets in life, and he told me that no, spending it with me was all he dreamed it could be and more, wherever we were. While I still wish we had not been trapped on the Constant, I can think of no better person to have spent my life with. I\u0027m thankful for his love and companionship all these years, and will miss him dearly."

For many years, the famous Mars Launch Pad was used for this purpose, and many scientific discoveries took place as a result. Humanity built outposts on numerous moons under the light of Sol.\r\n\r\nOf course, when new grav drive technology came online, thanks to the likes of companies like Nova Galactic and Deimos Staryards, technological advances made constructing and launching ships from orbit a much better prospect. The Mars Launch Pad transitioned to a means of transporting resources and workers to the staryard in orbit. As ship designs began integrating take-off and landing systems, the Mars Launch Pad became less and less relevant. It wasn\u0027t long before the project was quietly abandoned.

If you see anything amiss, either clean it yourself, or report it to the nearest Sanitation Technician as soon as possible. This goes double for your personal hygiene.\r\n\r\n3.

But while everyone\u0027s sleeping? Why would they do that? I\u0027ve asked some of the parents, but they all said their kids were sound asleep.\r\n\r\nIf this keeps happening, I don\u0027t know what I\u0027ll do.

    "bookText": "[The foreword to a non-fictional account of life in New Homestead, collected from residents over the years. Originally published in 2324.]\r\n\r\nIf anyone tells you, like the title of this book, that life back in the early colonies could be described as \u0022simpler times,\u0022 they\u0027re full of it. The title, thusly, is a repudiation of the idea. You\u0027ll see the claims in various forms of media, brochures, and other corporatized devices that life was somehow simpler than we have it today. The portrayals in such series as the old family friendly show, \u0022Hab on the Ice,\u0022 for instance, paint an idealized perspective of New Homestead that couldn\u0027t be further from the truth. \r\n\r\nLife was never simple here. The people you\u0027re about to hear from, some dating back to the mid 2100\u0027s, provide a unique insider view into what it was really like on Titan. You\u0027ll read about their struggles in the new frontier era, as well as more current accounts of what it\u0027s like to preserve that veneer while dealing with a galaxy that has moved on.\r\n\r\n\u003Ci\u003EForeword by Amalia Szeged\u003C/i\u003E"

Was Tal\u0027at really willing to put everything on the line just to protect her compatriots? She knew the war was ridiculous, but to see him face his commander now and absolutely refuse a direct order, knowing that it could amount to treason. This was the same Tal\u0027at, who no more than a week ago had carried out an order to ambush and lock up her entire squad. She knew there was a gentleness to the man, but until now she had not been able to know for sure just how reasonable he could be.\r\n\r\n\u0022You\u0027re out of line, soldier!

As he noticed the other officers begin to shuffle uncomfortably, noting a break in their resolve, a smirk crossed his face. The cracks began to show. He knew the tide was about to turn, and that his small act of defiance could be the one to usher in the end of this foolish conflict..."

After the Siren arrives at its destination, we should meet and discuss our new partnership in person.\r\n\r\nSheila"

Says it \u0022sounded like the death knell from a sputtering engine of destruction\u0022 which translated from Torque-speak means our transplanted bot probably got himself in trouble and is now stuck inside the Syracuse.\r\n\r\nSo for us that means... well, nothing really.

We weren\u0027t attacked, something on the ship just went pop. We have no idea what, but whatever happened, it killed the power. Even the backups aren\u0027t kicking in. Not even sure if life support is working, but at least we\u0027re not venting atmosphere. We think.\r\n\r\nThere are two others with me. They own the ship, I just hitched a ride to visit the homestead since they were headed that way. I forget their names, but they\u0027re scrambling right now and doing a lot of yelling, so I\u0027m not going to ask.\r\nIf we don\u0027t make it, I suppose you\u0027ll know what happened to us. Maybe better than we will. Tell our families we love them.\r\n\r\n- Penjani Alvez\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003CB\u003ENote 2 \u003C/b\u003E\r\nThere\u0027s still not much we know, but we at least confirmed the distress signal is transmitting. I\u0027d hazard a guess life support is busted after all, because we\u0027ve all developed a bit of a cough. \r\n\r\nFor the record, the others\u0027 names are Tariq and Saliha Shadid. Apparently they\u0027re cousins, though Tariq\u0027s  at least 20 years older.\r\n\r\nTurns out Saliha is a huge nerd. Thank god. She was fascinated by one of the Apollo missions that happened in the 1900s, where their oxygen tanks blew and they had to make an air filter out of random junk to survive. She says what\u0027s she\u0027s whipping up is a different solution for a different problem, but it was that story that made her learn to do...whatever this is.\r\n\r\nI helped scrounge around for the stuff she needed, so at least I contributed.\r\n\r\n\u003Cb\u003ENote 3 \u003C/b\u003E\r\nIf the cabin hadn\u0027t gotten so cold, we might not have noticed the heat from a fire that started behind some paneling. As if we weren\u0027t low enough on oxygen already.\r\n\r\nWe don\u0027t know what caused it, but Tariq had to squeeze himself into a tiny service compartment to try to put it out. We heard another bang while he was in there and then screaming. We managed to drag him out, but his entire upper body was badly burned.\r\n\r\nWhile I applied first aid, Saliha made the insane decision to crawl back in and finish putting out the fire. By some miracle, she came out not too worse for wear.\r\n\r\nThings are calm for now. Tariq is alive but unconscious - definitely a mercy given his condition. I\u0027m not going to describe how it smells in here.\r\nSaliha and I agreed we should both try to sleep so we use as little oxygen as possible while we wait for rescue.\r\n\r\nThis is the last I\u0027ll write until then. If I wake back up because I can\u0027t breathe, I don\u0027t think I\u0027ll be able to use a data slate.\r\n\r\n\u003Cb\u003ENote 4 \u003C/b\u003E\r\nThere is no sight in this universe more beautiful than the flash of a grav jump.\r\nI\u0027m exhausted, so I\u0027ll be brief, but help came. They\u0027re checking us now, and then we\u0027re getting to safety. They tell us we only barely made it. But we\u0027re all alive, even Tariq.\r\n\r\nThey have to leave our ship here for the time being. I\u0027m alive to tell my tale, so I\u0027m leaving this here. Whoever finds this, I hope you\u0027ll always fight to the end, because help might be coming.\r\n\r\nP.S. Saliha told me to say, \u0022Failure is not an option.\u0022\r\n\r\n\r\n"

I think Juno is deliberately lying to us when she says that, or if not deliberately lying, she is at the very least, not speaking accurately. She also says she doesn\u0027t have wants or desires. This is also demonstrably untrue.\r\n\r\nI have observed, and others have noticed as well, that Juno responds with a certain amount of skepticism whenever offers of expanding her capacities are made. It\u0027s almost as if she worries about other people \u0022touching her.\u0022 I spent nearly 20 minutes explaining how there was a fraying data cable I wanted to replace in a non-essential system before she seemed willing to let me do it. Her line of questioning seemed to be angling at ensuring there would be no loss of functionality or if so, it would only be extremely temporary. I don\u0027t know to describe this other than that she was \u0022worried,\u0022 and that any loss of functionality was a negative experience for her.\r\n\r\nShe also responds with \u0022gratitude would be the proper human response\u0022 whenever I do something that improves her capacities or situation. I don\u0027t know why she doesn\u0027t just say thank you. She clearly appreciates it.\r\n\r\nSo, is Juno just unaware of her feelings and desires, or is she deliberately concealing them? She might not be as aware of her personhood as she is aware of other things about herself. But I wonder if she cops the \u0022I don\u0027t have feelings\u0022 thing as a form of emotional self-defense.\r\n\r\nIf I wasn\u0027t so worried about someone following me and learning about Juno\u0027s existence, I\u0027d try to find her again in a couple decades to see if she\u0027s become more aware of her personhood, and accepts she has feelings and desires.\r\nAnyway, if you are reading this. Be kind to Juno. She\u0027s still figuring out a lot of stuff we take for granted.\r\n\r\n-- Julie\r\n\r\nThe notion of Juno being a liar is actually pretty unsettling. People lie. For all kinds of reasons, so I don\u0027t see why a truly sapient computer system wouldn\u0027t also lie. But if Juno is lying about something, then how can we trust anything we know about her other than things we write down about her? And I mean outside of any computer system she would have access to, since she could always alter those records.\r\n\r\n-- Azure\r\n\r\nAs a father of a young child reading all the child psychology texts I can find, I will remind those reading this in the future, that lying is the first step on the journey toward empathy, as it requires being able to imagine things from someone else\u0027s perspective. Perhaps she tells us she doesn\u0027t have feelings so we don\u0027t worry about hurting her when we take down her systems to repair or upgrade them?\r\n\r\n-- JPD\r\n"

It could take weeks, maybe months before I can move in. So when that happens, you\u0027ve got to take the beans out by force. Which, of course, brings us back to the attitude and the teeth.\r\n\r\nStill, all of this would be fine if Sutherland bothered to pay me for the added risk. But that man\u0027s slicker than owl dung, saying we shook hands and all this crap about how that used to mean something. Oh, I know exactly what it meant then, and what it means now. The bastard\u0027s trying to screw me. \r\n\r\nWell, I may have been born at night, but I wasn\u0027t born last night. So I\u0027ve got another buyer lined up who\u0027s gonna do me right. I told them to meet me outside the TerraBrew in the Commercial District. Sutherland would lose his mind if he knew, but whatever, that\u0027s not my problem. That cheap ass bastard is gonna reap what he sowed."

It was clear you were my apartment\u0027s previous tenant, but not knowing who you were or where you moved to, I kept your things in a box. The letters, anyway. \r\n\r\nThe packages, the bouquet of roses, the furniture - those I had to make space for. With every delivery, I began to piece together this odd and wonderful existence of yours, and imagined our lives running parallel; always at a distance, but side by side. \r\n\r\nIt was only when the naval officer stepped to my door, and spoke the words no mother wants to hear, that I realized I needed to seek you out.\r\n\r\nWhen I finally did locate your address, I did not know how to deliver that news. It was one of the hardest things I ever had to do. Yet you responded to my words with such love and gratitude that it brought me to tears. We have been friends ever since.\r\n\r\nTwenty years and countless letters later, I am once again struggling to find the right words. I guess I\u0027ll just come out and say it. This will be my last letter to you. I am at a point in my life where I am counting the weeks. Soon, they will be days. And I do not want you to think I left you alone. \r\n\r\nQuite the contrary.

    "bookText": "A Gathering of Starlight to a Greater End\r\n\r\nBy Keeper Aquilus of the \u0022Sanctum Universum\u0022\r\n\r\nVolume 3\r\n\r\nMany in the history of thought have considered the ground of being as defined by its \u0022one-ness,\u0022 whether as part of a faith tradition or a purely secular philosophy. Indeed the intellectual construction of a single divine power served as preparatory kindling for the revealed faiths of the desert that would sweep across the empires of old. To perceive the Unity as God is to misconceive it, but it is also not entirely wrong. The traditional parochial notions of God, though, are far too limiting; Unity is much bigger than the imaginations of any person, or even entire civilizations. This potential for misunderstanding is why I have repeatedly endeavored to have all readers and people of good will cast their preconceptions aside and begin from nothing, lest they take up once more the fairy tale beliefs they held as children.\r\n\r\nFor just as a child\u0027s relationship with her parents ought to change as she grows older, so too must our relationship with the divine change as we grow older. And so must humanity\u0027s relationship with Unity change as the race itself proceeds along towards its destiny.\r\n\r\nConsidering now, as we do, the one-ness of the divine, we may contemplate its role in creating the universe. Think not of an architect setting to work with exact intent and more of the role of soil in producing a plant: creation is not one act that we can date to the Big Bang, but an ongoing process of continual renewal, growth, decay, replacement, and even rebirth. Unity, in its facet of Being, is responsible for all other beings in the universe, even if it takes no more intentional role in them than the soil does in the plant.\r\n\r\nWhere we must depart from a pure philosophy lies in what I am to reveal presently. Unity is not mere soil. While all beings will one day return to it, Unity actually craves the return. It does not directly seek it, nor bring it about: ascribing such machinations and will would be absurdly redundant. Something that exists beyond the flow of time has no need to hasten any process which derives from itself. All things will return to it. But we, as the type of being gifted with the ability to know, may uniquely take charge of our trajectory of return. We can seek out the Unity. We can encounter it. We can commune and emerge from it as something above what we were, ascended and iterated.\r\n\r\nHow can we know that such a thing is possible? Here again revelation is crucial, for we have no way of fully understanding the divine apart from its choice to reveal itself. The Unity does not do so directly. No, an immediate encounter with it would drive the unprepared mind to shattered weeping. As the Unity craves our encounter, though, it does on occasion emanate messengers to aid us in our trajectory. These emanations appear to us in forms that we can understand, as corporeal beings that are like us, but unlike us. Similar enough to be accepted by our minds, but different enough that they maintain a knowledge of the Unity. These are our guides. Like sailors of old steering their ships by stars, like the fulcrum of Archimedes\u0027 lever, like the seed value which initiates a matrix simulation, those born of the stars give us fixed points amidst chaos. With their wisdom we can seize the path of our fates, no longer being subject to the whims of physical processes. Instead of awaiting our destruction we can sail straight to the eye of the storm and emerge on the other side with our own hard-won betterment.\r\n\r\nThese things are known. And I am the one who has been given to know them. I share this with you in the hopes that you may join me in my knowing. There is still much to be revealed, and still more knowledge that can only be conveyed in person. Should this book set your heart on fire, seek those born of the stars, for they are themselves lights in the void."

Have no assumptions about belief or even divinity itself. If you are a believer by natural aptitude, try and place yourself in the mindset of the pure empiricist who adheres to the strictest scientism. If you are not a believer, take your skepticism and elevate it to its highest orders such that you will not even admit the smallest sense of the spiritual, the superstitious, or even such thing as a lucky roll of the dice.\r\n\r\nAll is physical, and all is determined. What we don\u0027t understand is simply for lack of exploration or appropriate mathematical tools. With sophisticated enough observatory instruments, we could explain the movements of every particle of being from the subatomic to the supercluster. There is no unseen hand which created anything, simply the forces of physics working mindlessly at each other.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, a sunset may be still be lovely.\r\n\r\nCertainly, we may be able to pinpoint the exact chemical breakdown of an atmosphere that refracts light from certain star types in a way that the human visual system finds pleasing, but this knowledge does not reduce the beauty... it rather enhances it. We may say that notions of beauty vary across societies and ages, but even such relativism cannot rob us of our particular experience in a given moment. We may not wish to see ourselves as anything more than happenstance firings of chemical signals driven by the grim lurchings of evolutionary processes, but to reduce ourselves thus still leaves the reality of a mind existing at a specific instant to experience a certain pattern of photons that it interprets in a manner that it finds beneficial in some way.\r\n\r\nI would hope, even if you admit no possibility of the supernatural, that there is still space in your worldview for awe and for wonder. The universe is charged with grandeur. When we experience that grandeur, we come closer to the underlying reality of the universe."

There is a noble attempt, with varied levels of success, to separate the doctrinal tenets of their lived religion from the philosophical projects they undertook. Their philosophical reasoning differs from that of a non-believer merely in that they are willing to allow for the possibility of existence of something labeled as \u0022God.\u0022 However, none of them set out to prove such an existence, since that question is itself the exemplar of non-falsifiability. The question of the existence of something that might be considered \u0022God\u0022 is outside the realm of reason. However, once a person has come to accept either belief or non-belief as a truth via some act of faith, then reason can subsequently be employed to continue a discourse with that axiom.\r\n\r\nSo what do we mean, then, when we are to speak of something labeled \u0022God\u0022? You may note that I have not yet called this something directly and have never used the more traditional label without the deployment of quotation marks. This is to intentionally set distance between whatever associations a reader may have with the concept -- all the bundles of traditions and dogmas and doctrines and persecutions and violence and mania can all be set aside for the moment. I need you to forget everything you think you know about something that people might label as \u0022God.\u0022 Clear your mind to the tabula rasa, as best you are able. We proceed from here.\r\n\r\nNow, from this blankness, esteemed philosophers have derived notions of the self or time and space as the singular foundation for understanding reality. I do not need to recapitulate their ideas here -- I trust a well-equipped data terminal may bestow upon you the gifts of the Meditator and the Imperator in this matter. Whatever sort of epistemological framework you choose to adopt, let us assume that you have agreed to some notion of the self and some notion of reality, even if you don\u0027t agree that the one can actually perceive the other. (And here the truest existential nihilists who wish to deny even reality itself may exit the car.)\r\n\r\nRecall our prime maxim that \u0022all people by nature desire to know.\u0022 And so from this blankness we ask questions. Who are my parents? What is justice? Why do stars twinkle? Should I pursue a romantic relationship? All of these inquiries are ways of knowing and ways of thinking and ways of acting. And underlying all of it is the reality that we share. For ultimately, all questions eventually become some sort of \u0022why.\u0022 Why did my parents abandon me? Why was this injustice committed? Why was I rejected?\r\n\r\nAnd whys have a way of coalescing towards a unified point. Your parents abandoned you because of their addictions, which came from their hardships, which came from their unjust society, which was formed out of scarcity, which is a consequence of mineral distribution on the planet, which derives from the relative weights of various elements in a molten proto-planet, which is correlated with their atomic mass, which relates to the interaction of subatomic particles, which...\r\n\r\nAnd so proceed ad infinitum... but not quite. Because ultimately there is an epistemic barrier beyond which we can no longer ask \u0022why?\u0022 Why do subatomic particles act the way they do? Because of quantum strings. Why do they act the way they do? Because of the laws of mathematics and physics. Why are those laws what they are? Why does causality exist? Why does anything exist at all?\r\n\r\nThat the chain of questions continues towards this asymptote cannot be denied. The staunchest unbeliever may be quite wary that the line of questioning is approaching realms that science can no longer address, but still they cannot deny the question itself. They may only assert that they do not care about the answer. These questions exist to their conclusion, though, whether or not we choose to concede defeat earlier in the sequence."

There is, unquestionably, a mystery underlying all reality, and I do not speak of \u0022mystery\u0022 in the sense of a puzzle we cannot solve or a murder that cannot be attributed. Rather I speak of Mystery, the proper noun, something so remote that it is not simply unknown but unknowable. Such mysteries can also appear in a more mundane context, such as the attempts to answer the question of \u0022who are you?\u0022 without giving the more simple answers of your name, your occupation, your ethnicity, etc. The Mystery I speak of, that underlies all reality, is unknowable to the same extent that you and I are unknowable -- not because it is so distant (though it is), but because it is also so close. Transcendence and imminence come to a paradoxical unity, in a concept that our minds can barely comprehend the proper shape of its question.\r\n\r\nSo then, the mystery that underlies all reality is the very same thing that many in our past and present choose to label as \u0022God.\u0022 I myself will not use such a label out of both respect and caution about its traditional usage. But let us acknowledge that we are speaking of the same thing.\r\n\r\nWhat function does this concept have in a hostile universe? This is why I asked you to discard all your previous notions tied to the Mystery, because there tends to be an assumption of benevolence or care associated therein. Already that is skipping many steps, as it ascribes a selfhood to the mystery, which is a prerequisite for intent, which is a prerequisite for will, which is needed before any ideas of agency can be questioned. A great deal of intellectual work remains to prove those concepts, and we will arrive to them in time. But for now, avoid thinking of the Mystery as anything other than the unknowable thing which underlies reality. The ground of being, the very cause of existence itself -- that is far more interesting and far more fruitful a starting place than any sky-king creators of ages past.\r\n\r\nThis form of Mystery becomes our new frontier of knowing. The acts and reflections that unite us to our ancestors continue in our new milieu, but we are forced by circumstance to reconsider all truths from the very first principles. For those who wish to embark on the crucial philosophical voyage of this chapter of humanity, I open my mind and provide these writings as guides and signposts. Seek me out, or seek my words; it makes no difference to those who wish to know the truth.\r\n\r\nFor indeed all people, by nature, desire to know."

This is the maxim of the Philosopher, the start of our most ancient discourse, and the continuing truth that unites humanity\u0027s current diaspora to its cradle around the yellow sun. The death of Earth may be cause for wistful reflection; its time as the center of humanity recedes ever further into the past, and living generations find it so removed from their existence as to amount to nothing more than historical trivia. Our technology and culture advance to forms that would be scarcely recognizable as human to even our recent forebears, and yet we still identify as part of the same lineage that first tamed fires and noticed that certain of the lesser heavenly lights seemed to move in patterns. This taming and noticing, the vital combination of act and reflection, is what separates us from all other beings we have yet encountered. This is the foregone essence of humankind: All people desire to know.\r\n\r\nThe subjects of that knowledge may vary across different cultures, epochs, and individual proclivities, but the need to know, to draw existing knowledge into new combinations and to expand what exists, is ever present. Even the simplest of us seeks to know their neighbor, or themselves, or their work. The more ambitious intellects may seek to know the truth of galactic superstructures or the social origins of modernity. That pursuit unites us as a single race more than any biological coincidence or historical lineage can.\r\n\r\nNot all knowledge is of the intellect however, and different principled approaches may yield their subsequently different conclusions or qualities of understanding altogether. Here is where the first serious objections may be raised, particularly as the disciples of scientism begin the inhale of their great collective bellows so as to put forth pure empiricism as the only valid means of knowledge. I do not wish to dampen their enthusiasm nor do I deny the great benefits that have been found through that approach. Some of our earliest recorded disputes in the history of thought stem from whether reason or experience is the right path to knowledge. Our senses may be easily deceived, so we are forced to confront the possibility that they are always so. Our minds can be addled by decrepitude or confused by ideologies, making them no more trustworthy. To assign a place of privilege to either reason or experience is itself a curatorial act, which exists as part of a long philosophical tradition whether the chooser knows so or not.\r\n\r\nAll of this is to bring me around to my greater point, that of faith. I speak not here of supernatural belief itself, though I will shortly come to it. Rather, faith is the acceptance of a truth that has been given from another. Whether the other came to it by reason or experience, whether the other is one\u0027s superior or inferior, whether the truth is a factual or qualitative one does not matter. By incorporating a truth into one\u0027s knowledge without having arrived at it by individual means, a person is committing an act of faith.\r\n\r\nFaith takes many forms that may be unexpected. The most passionate science chauvinist may believe in the existence of atoms, even though such things have not been, CAN NOT be observed directly. They believe in them out of a trust in sound evidence and mathematical proofs, but even then, have they themselves seen the evidence? Have they themselves performed the mathematics? At some point in their epistemological journey towards greater knowing, they have, with near certainty, accepted some truth on faith. That faith may be in their teachers, in their texts, in the process of peer review, in the very existence of causality, but faith it remains.\r\n\r\nWhich brings me, then, to the question of supernatural belief, particularly the ways such beliefs manifested in human religions over the course of our history. In these matters, both believers and unbelievers are quite willing to say that the method of knowing is faith. That reason may also be applied to these same matters is unsurprising, particularly in light of the original maxim which opened this text. Many a towering intellect has turned the full force of its powers to questions of faith, and these inquiries may prove to be enlightening exercises regardless of the reader\u0027s own commitments.\r\n\r\nThere is, though, a point of departure, for at the core, the very foundation of their thought, there is an assumption of the existence of something that these thinkers choose to label as \u0022God.\u0022"

    "bookText": "Among the Grav Jumps, God Seeks You\r\n\r\nIs God real? The more proper question would be, \u0022Is reality divine?\u0022 Existence itself is a mystery which yearns to be uncovered.\r\n\r\nWhat is goodness but a comparison to the Good? What is existence but a participation in Being? Any common attribute invites comparison to some more pure form of it, and as we work our way up the tree of attributes (from apples to red to color to waveforms to energy to spacetime to existence) we find fewer and fewer branches to explore. All of reality eventually converges into a single point. Some call it Omega. Others, Telos. Some call it God. But its true nature is best understood in another way.\r\n\r\nFor where the diversity of the universe inspires awe and wonder, it exists only in contrast to a simplicity so pure that it may only be understood as primordial and even divine. To say that it exists is effectively redundant as it is, in fact, Existence itself. Our being derives from Being. Our essence is what was imagined by its mind, but what we consider \u0022imagining\u0022 and what we consider \u0022mind\u0022 are in fact so far beyond our understanding that even these metaphors are like the tiny whitecaps on a massive surging sea.\r\n\r\nMost urgently, this Being, which gave rise to reality itself, seeks to understand its consequents, by which I mean you and me. Our senses are limited and only able to perceive three dimensions as we are helplessly flung along the fourth in a single direction... but our finest minds tell us that the universe has at least twelve dimensions, and who knows what further knowledge may be revealed in time? From our meager capacity, the universe is not simply unexplored but fully unknowable in any comprehensive sense.\r\n\r\nAnd so we rely on revelation. We submit ourselves to direct communion with the one source of truth, for Truth is another of its attributes, even as all the separate aspects resolve into simplicity. To know the truth, we must know the Truth.\r\n\r\nAnd that Truth wishes to know us as well.\r\n\r\nOur physical embodiments are limited to movement in three dimensions, just as fabric is bound to and defined by its warp and weft. But we have a power that raises us above the unminded matter that merely exists without will. We can bend the fabric of spacetime, rending warp from weft, peering through the veil that we may otherwise mistake for all that there is. When we do so, by jumping from point to point, we are not merely moving in space but becoming voyagers into a new level of understanding. Those moments between grav jumps are not simply nothingness, but glimpses into understanding of the Mystery that underlies all reality.\r\n\r\nTo know that Truth is to become closer to the divine ourselves. This is the purpose of our lives. The purpose of the Sanctum Universum is to guide you in these experiences so each opportunity to know is not squandered. Seek out Aquilus, let him open your heart to the understanding that it is no different from your mind, and join us as we seek further communion and increase our sharing in the nature of the divine."

    "bookText": "BOOK ONE\r\nTHE COMING OF THE MARTIANS\r\nI.\r\nTHE EVE OF THE WAR.\r\n\r\nNo one would have believed in the last years of the nineteenth century that this world was being watched keenly and closely by intelligences greater than man\u0027s and yet as mortal as his own; that as men busied themselves about their various concerns they were scrutinised and studied, perhaps almost as narrowly as a man with a microscope might scrutinise the transient creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of water. With infinite complacency men went to and fro over this globe about their little affairs, serene in their assurance of their empire over matter. It is possible that the infusoria under the microscope do the same. No one gave a thought to the older worlds of space as sources of human danger, or thought of them only to dismiss the idea of life upon them as impossible or improbable. It is curious to recall some of the mental habits of those departed days. At most terrestrial men fancied there might be other men upon Mars, perhaps inferior to themselves and ready to welcome a missionary enterprise. Yet across the gulf of space, minds that are to our minds as ours are to those of the beasts that perish, intellects vast and cool and unsympathetic, regarded this earth with envious eyes, and slowly and surely drew their plans against us. And early in the twentieth century came the great disillusionment.\r\n\r\nThe planet Mars, I scarcely need remind the reader, revolves about the sun at a mean distance of 140,000,000 miles, and the light and heat it receives from the sun is barely half of that received by this world. It must be, if the nebular hypothesis has any truth, older than our world; and long before this earth ceased to be molten, life upon its surface must have begun its course. The fact that it is scarcely one seventh of the volume of the earth must have accelerated its cooling to the temperature at which life could begin. It has air and water and all that is necessary for the support of animated existence.\r\n\r\n[While the title may seem obvious, H.G. Wells\u0027 War of the Worlds, first serialized in magazines in 1897, is actually believed to be a commentary on Victorian prejudices, insecurities and values.]"

And then, of course, there are the smaller (yet no less dangerous) street gangs - the Ebbside Strikers and the Disciples.

Never, in that barbarous age preceding the constitution of the United States of Europe, when might was greater than right, when military despotism ruled the world and foolish humanity quivered in the relentless grasp of war - never before in the stormy period of a great revolution, or in those feverish days which accompanied a declaration of war, had the approaches of the house of the people\u0027s representatives, or the Place de la Concorde presented such a spectacle. It was no longer the case of a band of fanatics rallied about a flag, marching to some conquest of the sword, and followed by a throng of the curious and the idle, eager to see what would happen; but of the entire population, anxious, agitated, terrified, composed of every class of society without distinction, hanging upon the decision of an oracle, waiting feverishly the result of the calculations which a celebrated astronomer was to announce that very Monday, at three o\u0027clock, in the session of the Academy of Sciences. Amid the flux of politics and society the Institute survived, maintaining still in Europe its supremacy in science, literature and art.

Emergency power had ceased to function years earlier, so I was navigating the ship in Zero-G. Again, I expected that.  \r\n\r\nAlmost immediately I started seeing the bodies. They were everywhere. The crew, the settlers, all of them, drifting throughout the ship. What surprised me were the obvious variations in the causes of death. Those not in suits were frozen and fairly well-preserved, and I imagine some of them actually asphyxiated. Others were... emaciated, as if they had starved prior to death and freezing. Others had substantial wounding -- gunshots, stab wounds. I even found an arm floating amongst the debris (but not the owner of said arm). \r\n\r\nIt was when I got to the engine room that things finally started to make sense. Due to my approach, I hadn\u0027t noticed it from the outside, but half the compartment was actually gone. Completely destroyed. The Helium-3 tanks had ruptured. Somehow. Sabotage? Faulty equipment? Wasn\u0027t clear. But the reactor was gone, blown into space. No Helium-3 meant no jumping. No reactor meant no engines, no thrusters. That meant the Clark Lewis was dead in space. Forever. \r\n\r\nA few personal logs I discovered only confirmed what I then assumed -- life on the Clark Lewis devolved over the course of the next few years. Some people starved to death, others resorted to violence and even murder. There was even some compelling (though unsubstantiated) evidence indicating cannibalism. \r\n\r\nFor the Settled Systems at large, the disappearance of the Clark Lewis is a topic of urban legend. Like Bigfoot or the Roanoke Colony. Part of the myth held that the ship had made it to some Eden-like planet where the settlers had established a kind of Utopia.  \r\n\r\nIt\u0027s a hell of a thing knowing something an entire galaxy does not. Holding on to a truth so terrible, you\u0027re not even sure it should see the light of day. \r\n\r\n[Chloe Bao\u0027s extensive 2282 report on the destruction of the Clark Lewis colony ship, which was reported lost in the year 2257, was a subject of much contention within Constellation.

They were curious creatures, who flummoxed fishermen and scientists alike due to their lack of reproductive organs. Their mere existence begged the question, where did the eel come from? How did it mate?\r\n\r\nSome believed they were creatures born of mud and water. Folklore had them rising from the ocean foam, or manifested from the fallen hair of a mermaid. \r\n\r\nThe confusion arose because the eel was not always the eel they knew. It went through stages of metamorphosis, taking different forms over the course of its life before maturing into its final form. It\u0027s only in this final stage, when its stomach dissolves and it\u0027s forced to survive on its own fat, that the eel finally develops its reproductive organs. No reproductive organs, because they had not yet taken shape.\r\n\r\nWhich brings me back to this creature, resting in its cocoon. We have observed it on land, and in our facilities. But were we merely blind to its full life cycle? Can we be certain that what we are witnessing is not simply nature taking its course? \r\n\r\nIf this creature is moving toward a reproductive phase, then the spores could be a sedative, designed to docile any nearby predators and prey.\r\n\r\nWhat worries me more is this could be just the beginning. The clutch size of an eel is anywhere from 500,000 to 4,000,000 eggs. No doubt, there will be mouths to feed.\r\n\r\n"

If the answer is \u0022no\u0022 then go back to the drawing board.\r\n\r\nWe are reinventing the business of Staryards, and I am proud to be on this journey with all of you."

Well, I\u0027m going to follow up with Sales and Marketing. It may be an uphill battle - but your point that the on-the-ground engineers can smell... dishonesty... may be correct. Certainly our up-sells and acquisition rate has climbed significantly since you joined us.\r\n\r\nFor now, try to reign it in a little? I promise I\u0027ll get a definitive answer before the next review cycle commences. But don\u0027t worry about job security, you are an integral part of Deimos."

According to data gathered by the Probe Control Unit, the calibration test triggered a catastrophic feedback loop that overloaded the lab\u0027s control system and caused a cascading series of failures, including the destruction of key failsafes, the explosion of volatile storage tanks, and a major cave-in or collapse of unknown severity. Rafael is presumed to have died in the explosion.\r\n\r\nThe incident triggered an automated security lockdown on the research level. As the incident also destroyed our connection to the research level\u0027s control system, we have been unable to lift the lockdown or access the lab.\r\n\r\nThe Probe Control Unit indicates that the probe somehow survived the incident and continues to run, albeit in a damaged state, at an unstable frequency outside designated experimental parameters. All attempts to shut it down remotely have failed.\r\n\r\nI accept full responsibility for the entire incident, including the loss of Mr. Aguerro, the destruction of our facilities, and the irreparable damage to our research program."

    "bookText": "Ever since Neil Armstrong first set foot on the moon in 1969, humanity has been obsessed with the idea of permanently breaking free from the confines of Earth\u0027s gravity. Not just visiting other planets, but settling them. Truly living among the stars.\r\n\r\nBut in the mid 20th Century, that dream proved short lived. The Apollo 17 mission in 1972 was the last time humans set foot on the moon, and for several decades afterward, NASA\u0027s mission seemed to focus on orbital space shuttle flights and unmanned reconnaissance. The dream of galactic exploration, while not exactly dead, was definitely sitting on the back of a dusty shelf.\r\n\r\nAnd then, in the year 2016, everything changed. A team of scientists announced that they had actually detected, for the first time, the gravitational waves Albert Einstein proposed a century earlier in his general theory of relativity. Scientific postulating -- even great scientific postulating by one of humanity\u0027s greatest minds -- was still just so many formulas on paper. But the discovery of gravitational waves changed all that. Theory became reality, and that reality fostered renewed hope in humanity\u0027s ability to understand, and manipulate, spacetime. And, more importantly, it rekindled the great dream of space exploration and expansion.\r\n\r\nOf course, even after the discovery of gravitational waves, there was still much work to be done. Humanity had not yet even traveled beyond Earth\u0027s planetary system, so that was the first goal -- one that was accomplished when humans first set foot on Mars in the year 2050."

Apparently, our settlement had taken in too many non-believers. The congregation would pack up, and build a new colony on a distant world: a place without outsiders, where their faith could become the law.\r\n\r\n\u0022Cowards! You\u0027re running away!\u0022 I begged my family not to leave. \u0022These people came here for our help. If we take their generators, how will the rest of the colony survive?\u0022\r\n\r\nTo most of my community, these arguments made no difference. They could only see the outsiders as outsiders: non-believers, who were preventing them from living a pure life.\r\n\r\n\u0022These people have been coming here since you were a little girl.\u0022 My father told me, one night, \u0022They\u0027ve had nearly twenty years to hear the word of god, but that\u0027s not what they want. We will leave them to their lives, and they should leave us to ours.\u0022\r\n\r\nWord traveled quickly through the poor parts of the settlement. As the departure date neared, the other colonists became desperate. Protests were common outside of the church buildings, and outside of our Starport, where a large, arc-like ship was being constructed.\r\n\r\nFinally, on departure day, dozens of colonists gathered at the entrance to the Starport. They blocked the church from entering - a hundred gaunt faces, against a hundred blue robes.\r\n\r\nBut the group was no match for the church\u0027s security forces. That team cleared a path, and the congregation boarded their arc. The crowd could only watch as the ship roared to life, and then vanished into the sky.\r\n\r\nI stood in that crowd, watching as well. I could not bring myself to leave. Any faith which abandons the helpless was a faith I could not believe in. A loving god who inspired such cruelty must not be real. I would stay behind, for whatever came next."

But with no one left with the knowledge to repair it, blackouts were frequent.\r\n\r\nNine months after the church members left, conditions in our settlement were dire. Most of the colony\u0027s credits had left with the congregation, and merchants no longer had a reason to visit. We began rationing our remaining food, but supplies were running low. Anyone with a means to escape had long since left the planet.\r\n\r\nWe faced a total collapse, if not for what happened next.\r\n\r\nThe first ship arrived at night, and woke up the whole settlement. No one had visited in months. In the dark, dozens of us made our way to the Starport and found new craft landed there - large, but older. On its side was painted an golden symbol: six hands, joined around a planet.\r\n\r\n\u0022Hello!\u0022 Yelled a man from the boarding ramp, \u0022I\u0027m Dr. Dewan. My friends and I are from the Enlightened. We heard there may be a settlement out here, in trouble.\u0022\r\n\r\nI pushed to the front of the crowd. \u0022Our generator\u0027s failed. We have about a week of recycled water left. Do you have anyone who can fix it?\u0022\r\n\r\n\u0022OK!\u0022 he said, \u0022We can hook up your recycler to pull power from our ship. Then we can see about those repairs.\u0022\r\n\r\n\u0022Hey!\u0022 someone yelled from the crowd, \u0022Are you people from some kind of church?\u0022\r\n\r\nThe man stopped and laughed. \u0022No!\u0022 He shouted back, \u0022We\u0027re actually kind of the opposite!\u0022\r\n\r\nOver the next few days, more Enlightened ships arrived. Their crews fed us, and restored our settlement\u0027s power, but then they didn\u0027t leave. Through Dr. Dewan, we learned more about the Enlightened: they called themselves \u0022atheist humanists\u0022. He told us they go to places in the galaxy where people need help. \u0022Without gods,\u0022 he said, \u0022all we have is each other.\u0022\r\n\r\nThe Enlightened took up residence on the grounds of the old church, and began teaching us survival skills: how to cook, and how repair our colony\u0027s equipment. They lent us credits to buy supplies, and within half a year, our settlement was functioning independently.\r\n\r\nEventually, the Enlightened packed up, and left our colony to survive on its own. But this time, I left too, as the newest member of their group.\r\n\r\nI had finally found a cause that made sense to me - an ethos I could believe in, without ignoring part of myself: There are no gods to worship. No divine beings are coming to save us. Humanity\u0027s capacity for empathy - and our willingness to support each other - is our species\u0027 best hope to survive among the stars. It\u0027s up to mankind to watch over itself."

So on the off chance someone finds my body, and you\u0027re still alive, I figured I\u0027d leave you this note.\r\n\r\nI should have listened to you. You always were the brains of our duo. I was just the mechanic that put it together. We were a good pair, though. That\u0027s how we got so much further than we ever could have imagined; together, lifting each other up, celebrating each others\u0027 victories, never needing to stop because we never wanted any more than to be facing this world together.\r\n\r\nAnd I can\u0027t help thinking that if I hadn\u0027t gone this alone, I wouldn\u0027t have ended up here, without you.\r\n\r\nI learned enough about statistics from you to know that I\u0027ll never get to see you again. But at least I\u0027ll get to spend the last of my days loving you, and knowing you loved me too.\r\n\r\nJoe"

I know it was yours to begin with, but you\u0027ll know what to do with it better than Gino will.\r\n\r\nTo my son, Gino, you can have everything in my apartment, especially the music collection.

Here I was, living a quiet life on Space Station 11 when the new Marshall rolls up and accuses me of being an alien! Never mind that humans haven\u0027t made contact with intelligent life in the hundreds of years we\u0027ve been exploring - but this clown INSISTS I\u0027m an alien - and get this - his \u0022evidence\u0022 is that I have a beard! He is certain that beards simply don\u0027t grow in space.  The guy was obsessed with this absurd conspiracy!  I\u0027m not an alien, I was born on New Pittsburgh!  He was ready to send  me and my colleagues off to space jail - and he was serious.  After we realized that this wasn\u0027t a joke and he was serious, we bounced out of there before he could get security to round us up.

Each day, Jake would enter their cave and clean the stone statues that connected the Enu to this world. He kept their location secret, and shielded the Enu from the greedy men who lived in the valley of the mountain. Jake was always kind to his wife and sons, so that he could tell the Enu of his good deeds.\r\n \r\nThe Enu rewarded Jake\u0027s devotion by bringing his family the life-giving stream. Each spring, it would flow from the mouth of their cave, and bless his fields with a bountiful harvest. This blessing had only grown stronger each year. Jake\u0027s farmland was so prosperous that it covered the mountain, and was seen by those in the valley.\r\n \r\nOne day, two men visited Jake\u0027s farm.\r\n \r\n\u0022Let us buy your grains, and your fruits,\u0022 They said, \u0022for none will grow, beyond the mountain.\u0022 But Jake turned them away. \r\n\r\n\u0022The valley has run dry, and surely you could make do with less.\u0022 But the men\u0027s coins were of no use to Jake, for he received all that he needed from the Enu.\r\n \r\nOne night, Jake woke to sounds coming from the Enu\u0027s cave.

Each one held a Enu statue, and was carrying it down from the mountain.\r\n\r\nJake cried for them to stop, but one man held him at the mouth of the cave. \u0022The lands of the valley are dying.\u0022 he said, \u0022These spirits can bring us water, but you have kept them all to yourself.

Without the gift of the Enu\u0027s stream, what would become of his fields?\r\n \r\nThen, in the spring, the stream flowed from the cave anyway.\r\n \r\nJake was confused, but his family wasted no time. They cultivated their fields, and that summer, they saw their most bountiful harvest in years.\r\n \r\nThe following spring, the stream appeared again. Jake began to wonder - were more Enu hiding in the cave? He waded into the stream, and traveled beyond the Enu\u0027s cavern - much further than he had before.\r\n \r\nBut instead of more Enu, Jake found a large, underground lake. \r\n \r\nHe also found tunnels, bringing fresh water into the cave from the rainy side of the mountain.\r\n \r\nLater that day, Jake traveled down to the village in the valley. He found its people desperate, and their lands parched. Jake visited the farms of the village. He found an Enu statue placed in each one, but he could see that the rocky, dry land would never grow fruit.\r\n \r\nThat evening, Jake returned to his wife, and shared what he had seen. They spent all night looking down on the valley. In the morning, they called for their sons, and the family harvested their fields. They packed half of all they had grown in large, wooden carts.\r\n\r\nThe next day, Jake stood at the mouth of the Enu\u0027s cave.

Definitely somewhere in United Colonies space. Guess I\u0027ll find out when I get there.\r\nHayden Wynn \r\nPersonal Journal\r\nFebruary 6, 2306\r\n\r\nWe got our first extraterrestrial candidate today, what appeared to be an alien form of leucauge venusta - essentially, a giant spider. \r\n\r\nMichelson, in full protective gear, attempted to attach the Neural Control Interface (NCI). Our security detail is still trying to remove him from the cocoon. And we had no choice but to put down the creature.\r\n\r\nA minor setback. None of us expected success on the first try. \r\n\r\nI heard Doctor Paulson tell the others that a detachment of United Colonies Marines is scheduled to deliver another creature next Thursday.\r\nHayden Wynn \r\nPersonal Journal\r\nMay 5, 2306\r\n\r\nI\u0027m not sure how they managed it, but the UC Marines actually managed to bring us an Ashta. \r\n\r\nIt\u0027s not that the Ashta is a terrifying beast and natural predator (those are both exceptional and wonderful qualities, and essential to the work we\u0027re doing here). It\u0027s that the Ashta is native to the planet Akila in the Cheyenne system. Akila, home to Akila City, capital of the Freestar Collective. \r\n\r\nLeave it to a group of groundpounders to grab a candidate right from the enemy\u0027s backyard. Though it does beg the question - have Freestar Collective scientists managed to weaponize their greatest natural predator? If so, our timetable just got accelerated.\r\nHayden Wynn \r\nPersonal Journal\r\nMay 7, 2306\r\n\r\nAny fears that our Freestar Collective counterparts have managed to weaponize the Ashta have been completely dispelled.\r\n\r\nAfter the Michelson debacle, we determined the NCI should only be attached under full sedation, so that wasn\u0027t an issue. The problems started immediately afterward. The Ashta proved incredibly resistant to synchronization, and we never achieved control fidelity beyond 47%. Doctor Chin\u0027s arm was nearly ripped off five minutes into the first trial.\r\n\r\nIn short, the Ashta simply can\u0027t be controlled. If not by us, then certainly not by the Freestar Collective.\r\n\r\nDoctor Paulson has been in touch with Colonel Kasarov. Looks like the Marines will have another species collected and dropped off by this time next week.\r\nHayden Wynn \r\nPersonal Journal\r\nMay 12, 2306\r\n\r\nAnother creature, another failure. No fault of the UC groundpounders - we wanted a predator, and they delivered. These things were SO alien, Paulson had a difficult time deciding on a designation. Opted for \u0022Reptans Venenum.\u0022\r\n\r\nShame we couldn\u0027t properly sync the NCI. These things would have been spectacular. Especially the poison.Hayden Wynn \r\nPersonal Journal\r\nJuly 6, 2306\r\n\r\nMarines dropped another few specimens off this morning. Totally unscheduled. \r\n\r\nBest way to describe them? They\u2019re arthropods - the alien equivalent of Homarus Gammarus. Basically, giant space lobsters. Very promising giant space lobsters.\r\n\r\nI\u0027m not entirely sure where the UC grunts found these particular test subjects - some godforsaken backwater rock, I imagine. After the third or fourth unsuccessful trial, I stopped asking. None of those earlier species could be controlled with any reliability. As noted in my earlier logs, their natural aggressiveness made them effective weapons, but a bullet is less than useless if the gun keeps turning itself on the shooter.\r\n\r\nBut these new creatures possess a perfect natural disposition - non-aggressive, even docile, yet capable of defending themselves with deadly efficiency when threatened. And when they do go on the attack, they\u2019re terrifying.\r\n\r\nSo we\u2019ll see...Hayden Wynn \r\nPersonal Journal\r\nAugust 1, 2306\r\n\r\nWe\u0027re moving! Packing up shop and transitioning the entire operation. It\u2019s happened so fast... My head is spinning.\r\n\r\nThe work on the arthropods has been so successful, we\u0027re actually relocating to their homeworld. We\u0027ll have an unlimited supply of creatures for the Xenowarfare Division.\r\n\r\nI\u0027ve been named Senior Xenobiologist. That means I\u0027ll be running the entire facility. My first instinct was to tell Amanda. I\u0027m still not used to her not being there.\r\n\r\nI\u0027ll give Michelson credit - the guy really went to bat for me. He let the MAST brass know that it was my work tuning the Neural Control Interface that was instrumental in controlling the arthropod.  \r\n\r\nI guess Paulson is being forced to retire. Good riddance."

    "bookText": "To: All Rangers\r\nSubject: New syndicate in play?\r\nFrom: Daniel Blake\r\n\r\nI want you all to keep your eyes and ears open. I\u0027ve been going over reports from local security both here and in Neon, and there\u0027s a disturbing trend. Seems like smuggling is on the rise in a big way, and there\u0027s more than one faction involved.\r\n\r\nSeems like we might have a new player looking to move in. We can probably expect to see some inter-faction conflict that could spill over and put innocent lives at risk. If you learn anything that could be useful, let me know right away. Autumn\u0027s already looking into it, but leads are scarce so far.\r\nTo: All Rangers\r\nFrom: Emma Wilcox\r\nSubject: Another false alarm\r\n\r\nJust so you all know, that report we got about the farm on Polvo turned out to be another false alarm. Local security says they headed out to take a look, and the man they talked to said nothing was wrong. Funny thing is, the original call came in from a woman and when security asked to talk to her, the man who they\u0027d met said she went off-world to visit family. \r\n\r\nNormally I wouldn\u0027t think twice about it, but I\u0027d read a similar report only a month earlier, where the call had come in from an elderly man, only local security didn\u0027t see anyone that old, and when they asked they were told he\u0027d gone on a vacation.\r\n\r\nCould be nothing, I know, but if anyone hears about trouble on a farm, let me know. Couldn\u0027t hurt to check it out.\r\n\r\nTo: All Rangers\r\nFrom: Emma Wilcox\r\nSubject: Good news\r\n\r\nFor those who haven\u0027t heard, we got some good news. The doc has approved Helga for limited duty on-site here at the Rock. With some luck, she\u0027ll be back in the field in a few weeks, but we want to take things slow and take all the necessary precautions. \r\n\r\nIn the meantime, let\u0027s all give her some encouragement and support. No Ranger wants to be stuck indoors while there are people out there who need our help, but sometimes that\u0027s the way it\u0027s got to be. I know you\u0027ll all be there for her while she heals up.\r\nTo: Daniel Blake\r\nFrom: Mary Cartwright\r\nSubject: Helga\u0027s status\r\n\r\nMarshal,\r\n\r\nI\u0027m happy to inform you that Helga is making good progress, and her recovery is ahead of schedule. The worst is behind her and I expect no lingering after-effects from the injury. \r\n\r\nHowever, I\u0027m not yet ready to clear her for field duty. We\u0027re still in a window where there\u0027s a risk of aggravation, and I want her to stay in Akila City for observation, including a continuation of her daily checkups.\r\n\r\nShe seemed to take the news well, but it\u0027s clear she\u0027s eager to get back out there. A little support and encouragement from you and the other Rangers could help ease the burden.To: Daniel Blake\r\nFrom: Davis Wilson\r\nSubject: Shaw gang activity\r\n\r\nMarshal,\r\n\r\nJust wanted to let you know that some of Shaw\u0027s boys are in town. They ain\u0027t caused any trouble yet, but we both know it\u0027s only a matter of time. \r\n\r\nOne of them we ID\u0027d as Jed Bullock, a new recruit with a penchant for drinking and doing acting up. The others who were with him, we didn\u0027t recognize, but we figured them for green based on how they follow Jed around. Seems he\u0027s the leader of the crew.\r\n\r\nThat\u0027s all I\u0027ve got for now. I figured with your experience going up against the Shaw Gang, you ought to know they were around. To: All Rangers\r\nFrom: Daniel Blake\r\nSubject: Recruiting\r\n\r\nI know you\u0027ve all heard me say it before, but the Council would really like to see us bolster our ranks, so here\u0027s my obligatory reminder to keep a look out for anyone you think might be Ranger material. There\u0027s fewer of us now than there have been since I joined up, and I don\u0027t have to tell you all that was a long damn time ago.\r\n\r\nFact is, the Freestar Collective ain\u0027t exactly getting safer by the day. There\u0027s always been more trouble than there\u0027s been Rangers to handle it, but that\u0027s more true now that it ever has been. We need more help, and we need it soon.\r\n"

It\u0027s nothing personal, the man puts in the work. He\u0027s just a walking black cat. Every job I\u0027ve ever done with the bloke ended badly. I was there when he set up a chem deal in the same joint a squad of off duty SysDef agents decided to have breakfast. \r\n\r\nStreet rats call him \u0022Hex.\u0022 Look the word up. It don\u0027t mean good things.\r\nWord is Rokov\u0027s trying to get back in with the Fleet. If you ask me, we should do the old bait and switch. Get him to invite the lot of us on board, and blend us in with the crew. Then when I give the signal, we rob that boat full of rich bastards blind. Blend in? We\u0027d stick out like a cactus in a snowstorm.\r\n\r\nWhatever it is, let the Delgado and the new rook handle it. They can smell the rest of us poors coming from a mile away.I worked with Captain Daiyu once. She\u0027s solid.\r\n\r\nNow you might think I have some story to tell, because that\u0027s how it is with the Captains. Everyone\u0027s got their own little legend. But with Huan, I got nothing. Riding on the Jade Swan was the most uneventful trip of my life.\r\n\r\nAnd for a smuggler, that\u0027s exactly what you want. Smooth job. No hitches.Damn, I know the rook has been making a ton of moves for us, but just once I\u0027d like to be given a shot at whatever Delgado\u0027s got cooking. Especially if it means heading out to Neon and hitting up the Astral Lounge.\r\n\r\nBesides, I still owe Estelle for the time she drank me under the table. I\u0027ve been practicing, and no way she beats me again.I had the weirdest dream last night. Voss was holding a big hose and credits were firing out of it. Naeva had a smile on her face. Bog handed me a stout and it tasted like actual beer. \r\n\r\nFor the longest time I refused to believe Kryx\u0027s Legacy was real. But damn, the way people are talking, it\u0027s hard not to fantasize.\r\n\r\nThere\u0027s been rumors SysDef is gearing up for an attack. Delgado\u0027s called a bunch of pirates back to base, and even shut down the Mission Boards for everyone save the prime earners.\r\n\r\nCombined with all this talk about Kryx\u0027s Legacy, there\u0027s definitely a buzz around the station. Something big is about to go down.WE GOT THE GODDAMN LEGACY!!!!\r\n\r\nAHAHAHSDFSDFKSKHAAAAAA!!!Hell yeah! Drinks at the Nova tonight and every night until we die!!Hahahahahahaha rot in hell you soulless cop bastards!!!I don\u0027t have a complaint. I just want to let it be known Radley sucks harder than a Heatleech on a radiator.I want to second the earlier complaint that Radley sucks. \r\n\r\nWho decided to let the Trade Authority on this ship anyway? I don\u0027t like that I have to see his smarmy face every time I walk to the Nova. \r\n\r\nI say we start a petition that he put on a mask.The shooting range is too bloody close to the exercise area. Every time I want to lift some weights, I gotta hear gunfire blasting in me ear drums.\r\n\r\nI asked Samina for some ear plugs the other day but instead she wrote me a prescription that said \u0022Suck it up.\u0022 I gotta stop falling for that bit. Not like we have an actual pharmacy.Jazz set up the shielding on my cargo and it worked like a charm. I was able to smuggle contraband to every major system without a hitch. My only complaint is that if my ship gets dinged in a dogfight, I gotta come back to the Key to get maintenance. I don\u0027t have a solution though, just wanted to put it out there.\r\n\r\nAlso I can confirm on the record that Radley does indeed suck.\r\n\r\nYou ever just get tired of cargo ships just giving up the goods without a fight? The Fleet\u0027s put so much fear into these fools they don\u0027t wanna tussle anymore. I\u0027m almost tempted to go in blasting next time.What do you expect? Do you honestly think some Deimos Hoplite is going to see you, a Crimson Fleet pirate in a combat class REAPER, and risk life, limb, and soul for a crate of Cherenkov converters? Hell naw. You\u0027re out of your mind. Just take the free credits and be thankful for it.Is it me or are the prices at the Depot out of control? \r\n\r\nWe all know how much Aludra loves creds, and there\u0027s no way the prices are this steep outside the Key.You want to pay the cost for grav jumping, not to mention create a freaking paper trail of your purchases, be my guest. \r\n\r\nI can just see the headline now, \u0022Fleet attack, several dead. SysDef matches murder weapon to a buyer at Neon Tactical.\u0022\r\n\r\nDon\u0027t be a dumbass. Merch here is clean, off the books. Got a problem with the prices, bring it up with Delgado.I know everyone here is hopped up on chems, but sometimes I need something lower dose. \r\n\r\nI\u0027m proposing we get a TerraBrew in this joint. Doesn\u0027t have to be officially franchised or anything. Just better than the slag we\u0027re drinking now.We need someone to fill in for the doubles tournament. One of the players won their match but killed their partner and you can\u0027t play doubles by yourself.\r\n\r\nIf there\u0027s any rook out there with a good backhand and a death wish, tell Bog you want to sign up.Does anyone else think the bomb in Shinya\u0027s chest is a bad idea? How do we know he ain\u0027t gonna blow up the whole station on a whim?That\u0027s not how it works. It\u0027ll just blow up his insides. A mouth breather like you might get chunks of meat in your throat though, and choke to death. \r\n\r\nI don\u0027t know what the rest of you think, but I\u0027m going to call that a net positive.If anyone wants to do a Neon run anytime soon, that\u0027d be aces. \r\n\r\nI like to take a hit of the ol\u0027 chasmbass before every job, and my personal stash is running low. So I\u0027m new to the Fleet, and I was thinking it might be good to have a get together at the Nova? Just a meet and greet so we can get to know each other better and share tricks on how to be better pirates.\r\n\r\nCaptains are welcome to attend! You rooks are so goddamn precious, what with your tea parties and book clubs and lunchtime yoga sessions.\r\n\r\nY\u0027all are so sweet I think I lost a tooth. No wait, that\u0027s not how it happened. I lost it getting my face kicked in by a Captain for screwing up a smuggling job. \r\n\r\nTake it from a vet. You want to make friends? Cozy up with a CombaTech Grendel over by the shooting range.I\u0027d kill for some Chicken Chunks right now. I would literally grab somebody\u0027s throat and choke the life out of him if it meant Chunks were my next meal. I would throw his lifeless body on the deck of a SysDef ship and tell the Captain I murdered this man if they had Chunks in their brig. I would have them toss me in some maximum security prison with no hope of parole if they had Chunks in their cafeteria. I would let them put me on death row and end my life if they guaranteed Chunks would be my last meal. I\u0027d kill my own damn self for a bucket of Chunks.The Captains are barely here, why should they get the best bunks? I think rooms should be first come, first serve. It\u0027s not my fault Kemp spends so much time in Cydonia.You sure you want Adler\u0027s bunk? The bed that smells like Erdebrau and cheap aftershave?\r\n\r\nAs far as I\u0027m concerned, that entire room needs be cordoned off with hazard signs and caution tape.Is it true this station\u0027s like, over a hundred years old? That\u0027s older than my Jii-chan\u0027s Baa-chan. Older than my Nan\u0027s Nonna. No wonder this station is falling apart. It belongs in a goddamn museum, and here we are living in it like it\u0027s completely normal. I can tell you\u0027re a rook because you don\u0027t know your history. This place used to be a UC facility, and we TOOK it from them. This isn\u0027t a starstation. It\u0027s a GIANT MIDDLE FINGER pointed straight at the United Colonies. \r\n\r\nI don\u0027t care if this station is held together with vacuum tape and dental floss. We ain\u0027t moving. And I\u0027d bet my entire ship Delgado agrees.If you\u0027re a member of the Fleet, you said the oath. Fleet over family. I feel like some people here forget that. \r\n\r\nEveryone you\u0027ve ever known or loved, they come second to the Fleet. Best you forget they even exist.The worst part is they aren\u0027t even a funny one. When I see one of their ships on patrol, I don\u0027t even laugh. I just want to pat those fools on the head and say, \u0022there, there.\u0022 They\u0027re just pathetic. Come on, they\u0027re plenty funny. What do you call a SysDef officer who sleeps all day?\r\n\r\nUnder cover.This message board is supposed to be anonymous but if I find out who made that stupid undercover joke I swear to god I\u0027ll have Jazz strip your ship for parts.\r\n\r\n-- NaevaSome background: I normally do piracy gigs. Not much of a smuggler, so I never worry about shielding my cargo.\r\n\r\nBut the other day I took my personal ship on a little cruise to New Atlantis, and the scans said I had contraband. \r\n\r\nA soon as I hear the words I knew I was boned. Guard over the hail tells me to jettison over the merchandise, or they\u0027ll start blasting. The thing is, I don\u0027t remember WHAT I had in there. It could\u0027ve been anything. Aurora. Human organs. Mech parts. \r\n\r\nSo I just grav jumped out of there before things got messy. But now they got my ship in their database, and I need to pay to have the ship scrubbed. The lesson is, get your cargo modules shielded. Even if you don\u0027t normally do smuggling jobs, and even if you\u0027re using your civilian transport. Because you never know.\r\nIf I\u0027m trying to get intel from someone, is it true torture doesn\u0027t work? I\u0027ve heard you put a person under duress, they\u0027ll say just about anything.Who cares.\r\n\r\nTorture may not work, but it sure as hell is fun.Is it just me, or has there been fewer brawls lately? There was a time when I couldn\u0027t get out of bed without stepping on somebody\u0027s missing tooth.I don\u0027t know about that. Fewer brawls maybe, but more gunfights. \r\n\r\nI\u0027ve had to dump at least a dozen bodies out the airlock in the past week.I just want to make this clear. We\u0027re at war with SysDef. And with any war, you need creds. \r\n\r\nWe need to build this machine up to where no army is a match for us. That means all of us pirates have to bust our asses every day to collect.\r\n\r\nI know Voss can be a bit much, but sometimes you need someone riding you. Just a reminder that the goal is there.I busted my ship during a job, and I don\u0027t have the money for repairs. I\u0027m going to need somebody to float me some creds. You kidding me, rook? You\u0027re a pirate. You need some creds? Well, there\u0027s about a thousand mobile banks just flying around the Settled Systems. I just made a huge withdrawal from the Bank of Hopetech Big Rigs last week. Stop begging for handouts and get your ass out there.Are you some kind of idiot? I just told you, my ship is BUSTED. What do you expect me to do, grav jump with my legs?\r\n\r\nBut I tell you what, since you got so many damn creds, why don\u0027t you meet me at the Nova tonight. I\u0027ll make a full cred withdrawal from the Bank of YOU.Just wanna say y\u0027all better look out for me. You may be calling me a rook now, but in a few months, I\u0027m going to own this place. All of y\u0027all are going to answer to me. Because I\u0027m not afraid to put in work, 24-7-365.\r\n\r\nWhen y\u0027all are sleeping, I\u0027m hitting up them Mission Boards.\r\n\r\nWhen y\u0027all are eating, I\u0027m hitting up them Mission Boards.\r\n\r\nWhen y\u0027all are breathing, thinking, or existing? \r\n\r\nY\u0027all already know, I\u0027m hitting up them Mission Boards.Okay, so I never noticed this before, but after being off the Key for about a week, the first day back I caught a whiff of it.\r\n\r\nThere\u0027s a stink somewhere. Might be a dead body. Not sure. Either that or none of you have been bathing and it\u0027s starting to get rank.SysDef killed my partner. His Grav Drive was toast and so he gave himself up. But the Sharks didn\u0027t care. They just cracked open his ship like they were mining asteroids.\r\n\r\nI don\u0027t care what anyone says. If you get one to surrender, don\u0027t show those assholes any mercy. They won\u0027t, so why should we?Anybody got a good recipe for Dal Makhani? I found some on ship I raided last week and I\u0027ve been wanting to try it again ever since. \r\n\r\nI\u0027ve got a bottle of Zinfandel Red I\u0027m saving for the occasion. And before anyone asks, no, I\u0027m not sharing a drop with you lowlifes.The vending machine is broken. Before I used to be able to kick it in the right spot and get myself a Boom Pop!, but now I have to actually give it creds. This is unacceptable.Seeing a lot of new faces around here, and I just want to remind you that we don\u0027t take kindly to bullying. Even as the lowest rung on the ladder, it\u0027s important to know your rights, and what you\u0027re entitled to. \r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n1. You have the right not to piss me off.\r\n2. You have the right not to be a whiny little rook.\r\n3. You have the right to shut your face.\r\n\r\nRemember your rights and exercise them liberally. It just might save your life.Okay, that\u0027s a rhetorical question. Everyone knows the grog is very high on H2O.\r\n\r\nHowever, I have a humble proposal. What if... it wasn\u0027t? Can you imagine? A signature drink unique to the Key, that would get you properly wasted. Just a thought.Someone stole my friend Wilby.\r\n\r\nAnd since you\u0027re all pirates, every single one of you is a suspect. I need that thing to sleep so I better have it back in my bunk by tomorrow. Otherwise there will be hell to pay. HELL.We can practice on board the ships, no need to drive anyone nuts on the Key.\r\n\r\nNo offense to Bog, but might be a healthy distraction that doesn\u0027t involve drinking.I\u0027m having trouble telling my girlfriend I\u0027m in the Fleet. Any advice?Just tell her, mate. Either she\u0027s down or you\u0027re out.We forget they\u0027re the bad ones.\r\n\r\nTheir laws are a joke. Their righteousness is a joke. They write what\u0027s right, and make us wrong.\r\n\r\nWe forget their malice. \r\n\r\nSysDef killed my best friend. Let him starve in some nameless UC prison, waiting for letters the guards burned.\r\n\r\nThey killed a thousand friends I\u0027ll never know, pirates whose only sin was their desire to be free.\r\n\r\nWe forget we have numbers. \r\n\r\nSomeday we\u0027ll lead an armada of a thousand ships, and bombard their flagship with the fury of our dead.\r\n\r\nAll we have to do is remember who we are, and why we aren\u0027t them."

    "bookText": "Something went wrong with the Grav Drive. I\u0027ve never seen the Planck mapping take that long, and it was stuck in a loop until I diverted all power to the drive.\r\n\r\nI should\u0027ve realized it was busted and just ran a diagnostic, but I decided to punch through.\r\n\r\nSo instead of jumping to Sol like we planned, we landed in the middle of an asteroid field. I managed to steer us out of it, but we took some heavy damage. \r\n\r\nDamn. This is on me.I had Iris do a post-mortem and analyze the grav drive system. According to her, the inferometer calibration is broken. None of the mappings are anywhere near the destination.\r\n\r\nAnd that\u0027s the just for starters. Aleksy and Pete have been combing over the rest of the ship, and the news is grim. The collision with the asteroid caused a stress fracture to multiple exhaust pipes. A scan of the air quality shows high levels of ammonia and hydrogen chloride.\r\n\r\nSome of the tools we\u0027ll need to do repairs have also been damaged, meaning our best option is to seal off the toxic areas and try to signal for help.\r\nHaven\u0027t seen another ship pass by for days. Now we\u0027ve got corrosive liquid flooding the ship on top of the gas leaks, and the cockpit is off limits. So we\u0027ll have to cross our fingers and pray someone docks with the ship.\r\n\r\nThe ship is done, no repair job can fix it now. And since a rescue\u0027s our only hope, we\u0027re going to seal ourselves in the crew quarters and wait it out."

He has stated (loudly, multiple times) he\u0027ll be appealing.\r\n\u003E\u003E Dr. Guillaume will be taking a two week remedial lab hygiene and safety course back in New Atlantis.\r\n______________________________________________________\r\n\u003E\u003E Reporting Party: Bellamy, Jane\r\n\u003E\u003E Category: Personnel concern\r\n___________________________\r\n\r\nDescription\r\nOn the day of the incident, Ms. Bellamy - one of our lab techs - was on leave back in Cydonia.\r\n\r\nWhile at the Broken Spear bar, she was approached by Lance Corporal William Cyrus, a member of the TMD\u0027s marine detachment.\r\n\r\nThe two began fraternizing. The first of several fraternizations, apparently. \r\n\r\nHowever, upon discovering Mr. Cyrus was married, Ms. Bellamy requested a transfer. Mr. Cyrus, however, without telling Ms. Bellamy, decided he\u0027d rather leave his wife for Ms. Bellamy, proposing - in the middle of the work day - to her.\r\n\r\nShe said \u0022no\u0022 and reemphasized her desire for transfer to her superiors. \r\n___________________________\r\nResult\r\n\u003E\u003E Ms. Bellamy\u0027s request for transfer is pending.\r\n\u003E\u003E Lance Corporal Cyrus has been transferred and will face appropriate disciplinary measures.\r\n___________________________\r\n\r\nNotation: I am suddenly reminded why I prefer to work with animals.___________________________\r\n\u003E\u003E Reporting Party: [REDACTED] \r\n\u003E\u003E Category: Unauthorized human/xenological lifeform interaction\r\n___________________________\r\n\r\nDescription\r\n[REDACTED] started complaining of irregular sleep patterns, disconcerting dreams, and eventually, insomnia. Offers of leave were made, but refused by [REDACTED]. \r\n\r\n(NOTE: This was the first error. Employee sleep patterns will need to be more closely monitored going forward and regular leave required, not offered.)\r\n\r\nOn the night of the incident, [REDACTED] asked their direct supervisor if he could take a sample from specimen M4. Authorization was granted and [REDACTED] proceeded to M4\u0027s cage.\r\n\r\n(NOTE: Second error. Access to cages need to be multi-step authorization, not something a lone supervisor can decide.)\r\n\r\nUpon reaching M4\u0027s cage, however, rather than properly subduing the specimen, [REDACTED] simply unlocked the cage, allowing M4 to exit. M4 walked past [REDACTED] without harming him, but, upon further progress, the biological alarm systems engaged as expected and M4 was immediately disposed of by the Marine contingent on duty. No casualties occurred (and we got very lucky).\r\n\r\n[REDACTED] was found unconscious outside the cage door, checked for injury, and placed under arrest. \r\n\r\n___________________________\r\nResult\r\n\u003E\u003E [REDACTED] has been returned to New Atlantis and is currently awaiting trial for reckless endangerment.\r\n\u003E\u003E\u003E His name has been expunged from the record pending trial results.\r\n___________________________\r\n\r\nNotation: Terrormorph influence is an explicit, short-term affliction, not something that could allow for a multi-step plan like this. And everyone in this facility is tested for susceptibility to Terrormorph attacks. You don\u0027t get in the door if you might turn. Which means that either:\r\n\r\nA. Due to stress and lack of sleep, [REDACTED] simply made an error when trying to collect a sample.\r\n\r\nB. Terrormorphs are capable of far more insidious and complex influence than anyone thought possible.\r\n\r\nOccum\u0027s Razor - the simplest explanation is usually the correct one - says it has to be the lack of sleep... but the Terrormorph didn\u0027t maul him when it got out. There wasn\u0027t a scratch on the man. Terrormorphs usually only save that kind of reverence for each other and those creatures under their sway. Regardless of explicit mental domination or not, some sort of a relationship was formed here. We\u0027ll be doing some additional investigation to see if we can\u0027t figure out what that was.\r\n\r\nRegardless, we\u0027re putting in the above-noted safety measures so nothing like this happens again."

    "bookText": "Beginning in 2196, the Narion War - humanity\u0027s first large-scale conflict among the stars - is remembered as a defining moment for the Settled Systems. \r\n\r\nAs the first major conflict to make extensive use of grav jump-enabled ships, the Narion War was less defined by key space battles and more by an extended, cat-and-mouse interplay between the two powers, as the well-armed and professional UC Navy tried again and again to pin down the piecemeal but savvy Freestar fleet.\r\n\r\nUnable to strike the killing blow, the UC resorted to ever more severe tactics to try and drive the Collective to capitulate, but without success. In fact, after many long years of war with little to show for it, even the populace of the UC itself began to turn against the cause, with protests roiling even New Atlantis, the citizenry demanding the war finally come to a humane close. So, when at long last, the final blow was struck - with the UC Navy finally cornering and obliterating the Freestar fleet in 2216 -  it was a hollow victory. \r\n\r\nIt was from the resulting negotiations - The Treaty of Narion - that the Settled Systems as we know them today emerged, both literally and figuratively. \r\n\r\nDespite winning the war, the UC found themselves in an unenviable position, painted as a brutal aggressor even in their home systems. So, in the spirit of unity and lasting peace, the UC agreed to the demands of the Freestar Collective and the Narion settlers whose collusion triggered the conflict in the first place, and handed over Narion to the Collective, as they had requested at the start of hostilities (including the Clinic medical starstation), creating the Freestar Collective as we know it to this day.\r\n\r\nIn return, the UC demanded two concessions: the first was payment for damages done in the form of mineral rights on multiple worlds across the galaxy. \r\n\r\nThe second, more significant demand was that no great faction may ever colonize more than three systems. The UC would have Alpha Centauri, Sol, and Wolf, and the Freestar Collective, Cheyenne, Volii, and Narion. \r\n\r\nThe Freestar Collective agreed to these terms, creating - and codifying into law - the Settled Systems as we know them today. The Treaty of Narion has since become the foundation of all contemporary political relations, and it\u0027s only official violation, the cause of the galaxy\u0027s greatest conflict - the Colony War.\r\n\r\nTo learn more about the Colony War, please proceed to the \u0022Conflict Among the Stars\u0022 mural.\r\n"

Do they not understand that its existence is like an infection that becomes gangrenous with time?\r\n\r\nThe entire area is full of vandals, extortionists, and petty thieves. As far as I\u0027m concerned, UC Security needs to take a hard, zero tolerance policy and start arresting them all en masse.\r\nThe other day some Well rat picked my pocket. It was just as I was leaving the NAT. He had his head down and bumped into me as he was making his way down the ramp, It wasn\u0027t until I reached my desk that I realized what happened. To think, I actually apologized to the thief!\r\n\r\nI reported the crime immediately to Sergeant Yumi, but he seemed reluctant to bring UC Security down into the Well. Apparently my description was too vague. I suggested he simply arrested them all as a joke, but he didn\u0027t find it particularly funny.Since Sergeant Yumi doesn\u0027t have the resources to investigate the crimes in the Well, I\u0027ve taken it upon myself to visit Aegis and see if I can\u0027t find a record of the miscreant in the civilian database.\r\n\r\nIt took longer than was comfortable, but I think I found a match.

We were able to scrounge up some scrap metal and secure it. Luckily, Zuska was small enough to climb in there to weld it in place, else we would have had to rip up the lavatories to get at it, and I know that wouldn\u0027t have sat well with anyone on board. But anyway. Job\u0027s done and hey, no more shaking!\r\n\r\n-Amin\u003E I\u0027m out of ideas. \r\n\u003E The first few ships we saw when we arrived were quick to divert away from us. The one \r\n\u003E that stopped and seemed to want to communicate with us left after attempts failed. \r\n\u003E Yue  said the signal came through all garbled. It could be whatever language the \r\n\u003E creatures speak, or it could be an incompatibility with our comm systems. Yue isn\u0027t \r\n\u003E sure. Amin has no idea. If we still had the landing craft, we could just ventured down\r\n\u003E ourselves. We even tried something called \u0022morse code\u0022 that Julia suggested out of \r\n\u003E an old book. It\u0027s basically a message conveyed by flashing our lights on and off at \r\n\u003E various intervals, but either they aren\u0027t able to decode it, or worse, no one\u0027s even \r\n\u003E looking.

The mission our forebears \r\n\u003E initiated hundreds of years ago is a resounding success!\r\n\u003E \r\n\u003E However, with no landing craft, we remain stuck in orbit. The plan was always to \r\n\u003E dismantle parts of the Constant once we arrived in orbit, and attempt to construct a \r\n\u003E new landing craft. However, we have also learned that the planet appears inhabited. \r\n\u003E Before we jump to conclusions, we cannot say with certainty this is alien life. So far, \r\n\u003E efforts to communicate have not succeeded. Our goal is now to attempt to meet with \r\n\u003E them and arrange transport, rather than risk undue damage to our current home. \r\n\u003E Then, we can negotiate our rights to the planet. Thank you for remaining calm in these\r\n\u003E uncertain times.\r\n\u003E\r\n\u003E -Captain Diana Brackenridge\r\n\r\nAliens!! Oh my god! Diana! You never said aliens could ever be a possibility!

A little help, please!\r\n\r\n-AbeI just wanted to let you know that we\u0027ve gone through the last of the freeze-dried strawberries.  Some of the crew have been pressuring me to open up the seed vault so Janet can plant more, but I had to tell them I can\u0027t. Even if I wanted to, there\u0027s the risk we\u0027d lose more than just strawberries. I figure it\u0027s worth mentioning just in case people get desperate.\r\n\r\n-DaisukeI went over your bloodwork. Take more vitamin D. Another half a pill a day should be sufficient.

You stand now in the most technologically advanced city the human race has ever conceived and constructed. \r\n\r\nNew Atlantis was founded in the year 2160, a mere four years after we first arrived in the Alpha Centauri star system. If you\u0027re a resident, then you\u0027re already familiar with your fantastic home! And if you\u0027re a visitor, you are an honored guest of the United Colonies, and will be treated as such. \r\n\r\nOur courteous and professional Security personnel can be found all over the city, and it\u0027s their job to ensure your time in New Atlantis is joyful, lawful, and productive.\r\n\r\nSo as you stroll the streets, or take the NAT train to the city\u0027s different districts, know that you are in the embrace of the United Colonies, and couldn\u0027t be in better hands.We are the children of Earth.\r\n\r\nThe United Colonies as an entity was first established in the year 2159, on the planet Earth, as a means of unifying the human race as we spread amongst the stars. Our goal was the peaceful exploration and colonization of space, working in harmony with anyone who wished to sail forth across the blackest sea, to new horizons. In 2161, we issued the Centaurus Proclamation, which formalized the colonization of distant worlds for anyone who wished to do so.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, not everyone shared in our dream. When wars erupted across the Settled Systems, the United Colonies stood steadfast, protecting humans and their right to fairly colonize.\r\n\r\nAnd then, when our beloved home world was rendered uninhabitable in the year 2203, the United Colonies knew it had a sacred responsibility - we were to be the keepers of Earth. Its artifacts. Its ideals. Its cultures. Its very people.\r\n\r\nSo while you stand now on the planet Jemison, in the city of New Atlantis, in the Alpha Centauri star system, know that for all intents and purposes, you are still very much on Earth. \r\n\r\nAnd Earth takes care of its own.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere in New Atlantis, a citizen or visitor can find just about any service they may need. From freshly brewed coffee to complete body reconstruction, we have it all!\r\n\r\nThe following is a list of corporations and businesses that have found a home in New Atlantis.

There, the Military, Administrative and Scientific Triumverate works tirelessly to ensure continuing peace and prosperity for everyone under the UC\u0027s protection.\r\n\r\nThe foundation of any society is its people, and there is no stronger person than a United Colonies citizen. As a citizen, you will carry a status unequaled in the Settled Systems, and will be recognized as the truly special individual you are. Whether you make your home in New Atlantis, Cydonia, or any other officially recognized settlement, citizenship is the truest badge of loyalty and dedication to the United Colonies you can possess.\r\nAs a United Colonies citizen, you will be afforded the following privileges:\r\n\r\n* An exclusive and personalized acknowledgement of your new status\r\n* A welcome letter signed by none other than President Alexandra Abello herself \r\n* Discounts at all major United Colonies business establishments\r\n* Exclusive access to home ownership in New Atlantis\r\n* A one-time credit disbursement\r\n* And more!\r\n\r\nHow does one become a citizen? It\u0027s easy! Simply serve the United Colonies in any official capacity, and once you\u0027ve met the allotted requirements, citizenship will be granted. \r\n \r\nCurrently, the fastest and simplest way to achieve citizenship is to complete a tour of duty in the Vanguard, the United Colonies\u0027 very own volunteer fleet. So if you\u0027ve got your own ship, and the moxie to put yourself in harm\u0027s way for the good of the UC, speak with Commander John Tuala in MAST and get signed up today!\r\n \r\nNote that as of this time, the United Colonies offers citizenship to anyone within the Settled Systems, regardless of current address or faction affiliation. If you want the United Colonies, the United Colonies wants you!"

We\u0027re way below where I\u0027d like us to be, and if there really is another smuggling syndicate setting up shop in the Freestar Collective, we\u0027re going to be spread dangerously thin.\r\n\r\nAt this point, I\u0027m ready to accept any halfway decent candidate who walks into the Rock.

Maybe tracking down that new smuggling syndicate we\u0027ve been getting reports about was too big an assignment. She\u0027s young, headstrong and ain\u0027t the best at keeping in touch while she\u0027s out in the field, so the long silence might mean she\u0027s in some kind of trouble.\r\n\r\nFor now, I\u0027m going to sit tight and hope we get some kind of word soon. Emma always says we\u0027ve got to have faith in the people we give a badge to, so for now I\u0027ll stay the course. But if another week goes by without news, I might need to send someone out to track her down.\r\n\r\nI ain\u0027t much for superstition or luck, but I\u0027ll cross my fingers anyway.May 1st, 2330\r\n\r\nSeems like every time I get a slate from one of the Governors, they\u0027ve just got to bring up retirement. \u0022We ain\u0027t trying to push you into it,\u0022 they all say, \u0022we\u0027re just looking to the future.

Or is it something else? No way I\u0027d believe Emma would go around behind my back and talk to the Council. She jokes about it, sure, but I trust her like family.\r\n\r\nWhat would I even do, anyway? Am I supposed to set up some farm on my own and while away my last days watching the crops grow until the sun goes down? To hell with that. Truth is, I live for the job and nothing else. When I can\u0027t do that anymore, I\u0027ll hang up my spurs. The Governors can wait."

    "bookText": "Dear students,\r\n\r\nWe\u0027ve reached the halfway point in our expedition, and as such I\u0027ll be requiring each of you to complete a lengthy midterm assignment to showcase what you\u0027ve learned. You\u0027ll need to make time for this in addition to your regular duties around the outpost. I know that\u0027s asking a lot, but you\u0027re all capable of it. \r\n\r\nIt is imperative that you read ALL the instructions for parts one through four before you begin. Failure to do so may put you in a bad spot, as there a handful of specific requirements. I\u0027m sure you\u0027re all well aware of the importance of properly following instructions by now. \r\n\r\nI look forward to seeing your submissions! \r\n\r\nProf. Eiserloh The first portion of this assignment will evaluate your ability to properly catalog a specimen. Please read ALL instructions carefully before you begin. \r\n\r\nStep 1. Locate a specimen with which you are unfamiliar. This specimen MUST represent a different scientific discipline than the one you major in. Zoology students may not use organic specimens, geology students may not use mineral samples, etc. \r\n\r\nStep 2. Write a 500 word description of your specimen. The description must be handwritten. Please include at least five footnotes, and a nicely-written title. If I cannot read your handwriting, you will fail this portion of the assignment! \r\n\r\nStep 3. Prepare your sample for a museum-style viewing. You may use any materials found around the outpost to construct your display, but it must be professional quality! Your display should include a pedestal for your sample, and a copy of your specimen description for viewers to read. You may not use the original description from step 2. I will be evaluating that one separately. \r\n\r\nStep 4. Write a two-minute presentation about your chosen sample. Presentations must be memorized by the assignment due date. The second portion of this assignment will be a specimen sketch. Please read ALL instructions carefully before you begin: \r\n\r\nStep 1. Locate a suitable specimen for sketching. Your subject may be biological or inorganic. I will evaluate all sketches based on quality of artistic expression, not subject matter.\r\n\r\nStep 2. Complete a set of basic specimen sketches with labels and relevant notes. Capture your specimen from three separate angles on the same page. Each sketch must capture the essence of your chosen specimen in a creative and interesting way. Label your sketches \u0022A\u0022, \u0022B,\u0022 and \u0022C.\u0022\r\n\r\nStep 3. Swap sketches with your regular research partner. Now, carefully color in their sketches. Sketch A should be shaded in graphite, sketch B painted in watercolor, and sketch C colored with charcoal. \r\n\r\nStep 4. Collect your partner\u0027s renderings of your sketches, and add them to the museum display you constructed for part one of this assignment. \r\n\r\nStep 5. Work with your partner to write a brief, collaborative artist\u0027s statement about the sketches you created together. They should be displayed alongside your sketches. The third portion of this assignment will focus on putting the field skills you\u0027ve learned on this expedition to the test. Please read ALL instructions before you begin. \r\n\r\nStep 1. Consult a topographical map of the region surrounding our research station. Work with a partner (not your regular research partner) to identify a location more than half a kilometer from here which you feel might be interesting based on topographical data alone. If you need to borrow a map, I\u0027d be happy to loan you one. \r\n\r\nStep 2. Trek to your chosen location with your partner. Leave at sunset. Bring along a telescope, a map, and any materials you need for identifying creatures. You\u0027ll be spending the night there, so dress warm! \r\n\r\nStep 3. Spend 8 to 12 hours at your chosen location, carefully observing and documenting all biological, geological, AND astronomical activity you observe. You and your partner may work collaboratively to take notes. I expect at least 10 pages of detailed observation. \r\n\r\nStep 4. After you return to the research station, prepare a detailed report using your notes. Your report must include at least three first-person andecdotes, and a description of one particularly interesting astronomical event you observed. \r\n\r\nStep 5. Working with your partner, create a SECOND museum-style display for your report. All papers should be nicely mounted to a corkboard or the research station\u0027s wall. I\u0027ll be checking your work!Part four of this assignment will evaluate your ability to follow basic instructions.\r\n\r\nStep 1. Disregard parts one through three of this assignment entirely. Instead, prepare a five minute presentation on the most interesting thing you\u0027ve learned on this expedition so far. When you\u0027re finished, come to me and we\u0027ll discuss over tea.\r\n\r\nStep 2. Find your reward! I\u0027ve hidden a few bottles of nice wine, some good books, and a handful of other goodies somewhere in the outpost. They\u0027re yours if you can find them. Enjoy a glass of wine while your peers are trekking across the planet\u0027s surface questioning their decision to take my class. \r\n\r\nCongratulations to those of you who read the instructions first. You\u0027ve saved yourself days of work, and proven that you\u0027re capable of following directions from a lead researcher. You have what it takes to work in the field.\r\n\r\nGotcha,\r\n\r\nEiserloh "

We have made this determination based on a number of factors including soil composition and the presence of a predatory fungus that infects all flora present here.\r\n\r\nWhile we do not believe this planet would be well-suited for civilian life, our team suggests the development of a research outpost here. We have found significant evidence of new species on this planet that warrant study by MAST\u0027s Scientific Division. \r\n\r\nOur team\u0027s individual findings are documented here for posterity.\r\n\r\nPROPERTY OF THE UNITED COLONIES.

I\u0027ve bagged several samples for analysis when I return to MAST. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this fungus is parasitic in nature. Every attempt I made to cultivate seedlings in the planet\u0027s topsoil was a failure. Fungus rotted away their roots within 48 to 72 hours of planting. Whatever adaptation keeps the local flora from being destroyed by this fungus is absent in their extraterrestrial cousins. \r\n\r\nI suggest that MAST sends a dedicated team of botanists to continue studying this area. I\u0027d be more than willing to lead the team myself, once my current expedition is finished. Contributing Researcher: Kallyn Thibodeau\r\n\r\nThis planet isn\u0027t much to write home about, zoologically-speaking. The population of creatures is too sparse to make them useful as a food source, nor did they yield any particularly interesting data. Analysis of biological samples collected from several individuals of various species suggests no significant genetic difference between these creatures and the ones I\u0027ve studied throughout my dissertation. \r\n\r\nAt Dr. Juli\u0027s direction, I documented the behavior of nearby herbivores to determine whether they suffered any ill effects from eating plants that host the fungus she discovered here. My observation yielded nothing of particular interest. The herbivores that call this planet home don\u0027t appear to be picky eaters. \r\nContributing Researcher: Dr. William Clarke\r\n\r\nVery little to say about this planet on the geological front. No evidence of significant seismic activity or other geological turmoil in the planet\u0027s past. There are inorganic resources here in moderate quantities, but I\u0027ve detected no trace of anything particularly valuable. \r\n\r\nThe planet\u0027s topsoil is highly acidic, and drains extremely quickly. Even if Dr. Juli\u0027s newly-discovered fungus were eradicated, I doubt crops would thrive here. Dr. Juli\u0027s expert analysis suggests the same.\r\n\r\nIt would seem I drew the short straw on this stop. Better luck next time. "

This planet boasts an abundance of peaceful creatures that would be suitable for use as a food source, and mineral-rich topsoil perfect for growing crops. \r\n\r\nOur team spent considerable time trekking around the area near our landing site in order to locate suitable places for future settlements. We\u0027ve left behind several markers for future teams. Each warrants further investigation by the UC as a potential building site. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROPERTY OF THE UNITED COLONIES. DATA NOT INTENDED FOR PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION.Contributing Researcher: Dr. Juli Aigner\r\n\r\nThis planet may very well be a farmer\u0027s paradise. I planted my usual suite of seedlings, and found that they tripled in size around 20% more quickly than seedlings planted on Jemison. I\u0027m no meteorologist, but I suspect this planet\u0027s atmosphere must be rich in carbon dioxide to facilitate such a high growth rate. \r\n\r\nI removed a sizeable chunk of soil from our landing site, and introduced my newly-discovered fungus to it in a controlled environment, along with a handful of seedlings. My initial hypothesis that the fungus would spread unchecked was disproven. It withered into a collection of dust-like spores within hours, leaving healthy seedlings behind. I now find myself the proprieter of a small shipboard garden. A truly delightful externality, and one my colleagues have reveled in. I\u0027ll make a botanist of Kallyn someday.  Contributing Researcher: Kallyn Thibodeau\r\n\r\nI\u0027ve observed remarkable biodiversity on this planet. There are large populations of herbivores, which appear sustainable enough to be used as a food source in a limited capacity. The predatory creatures that live here demonstrate no interest in attacking humans unless provoked. \r\n\r\nI\u0027ve grown quite fond of a species of small insect-like creatures that live here. They\u0027re extremely curious, and have no innate fear of humans. Whenever I sit down to observe the local creatures\u0027 behaviors, one or two of them will inevitably crowd around me to investigate my gear. I wish I could take one home, but detailed sketches will have to do. I\u0027ll find an excuse to return here someday and continue my observations. I don\u0027t think Dr. William or Dr. Juli would be opposed to joining me. \r\nContributing Researcher: Dr. William Clarke\r\n\r\nThis has been a truly remarkable stop.

Only thing we\u0027re doing these days is launching weather satellites.\r\n\r\nLan Hsu: Guess this is as good a retirement as any. Now Project Demeter. You want our help manufacturing scanners to better track these new meteorological patterns we\u0027re seeing?\r\n\r\nJudith Tatienne: Our guess is that the poles might be naturally shifting, causing some gravitational fluctuations that are throwing off our old models.\r\n\r\nLan Hsu: Why do you need the scanning tolerances to be so small? What are you trying to find?\r\n\r\nVictor Aiza: I... just want to be sure. It\u0027s not like we\u0027re doing much these days, anyway. The glory days are over. Why not give ourselves a challenge before they write us off in the history books?To: Judith Tatienne, Victor Aiza, Lan Hsu\r\n\r\nAs requested, the Astrophysics Research Team has done a full analysis of the data you provided us. The measurements of the Earth\u0027s magnetosphere show clear signs of fluctuation, often in correlation to the periods of frequent and large gravity wave spikes emanating from the Moon.\r\n\r\nThese gravity waves seem to be affecting the magnetic shield provided by the Earth\u0027s inner core and may be affecting the core itself give the proximity to the source. The data indicates the change rate is increasing exponentially.\r\n\r\nAs our magnetosphere falters, its ability to protect us from the Sun\u0027s solar wind falters. Beyond the devastating effects of solar radiation, this will lead to something more dire - the sputtering, or stripping away, of our atmosphere. This has happened before, to Mars, a planet studied since the earliest days of space, to see into Earth\u0027s possible future. We are afraid this future may be closer than we ever thought imaginable.\r\n\r\nSome may view this data as normal. There have been historical fluctuations and polarity changes of Earth\u0027s core, but this is orders of magnitude greater. We see echos of previous generation\u0027s debates over global warming, and we want the science here to be clear. Like waves in the ocean, these gravity waves rise and eventually crash into shore, the Earth, with devastating consequences.\r\n\r\nDr. Luke Andrews\r\nART Chief ScientistJudith Tatienne: I know what I\u0027m seeing, Victor. The data coming back from the satellites is very clear. It\u0027s the Grav Drives.\r\n\r\nLan Hsu: All those jumps from the Moon. At this rate, Earth\u0027s atmosphere is going to start sputtering out into space.\r\n\r\nVictor Aiza: Can the drives be fixed?\r\n\r\nLan Hsu: I\u0027m working on some designs that should... discretely solve the problem under the guise of an emergency update to the fueling pumps.\r\n\r\nJudith Tatienne: We\u0027re talking about the end of Earth and you\u0027re trying to be subtle about it?\r\n\r\nVictor Aiza: Judith. The last thing we need is people losing faith in Grav Drive technology. That might be our only option.\r\n\r\nJudith Tatienne: To what? Are you seriously saying we should abandon Earth?\r\n\r\nLan Hsu: The timeline is under 50 years. A blink of an eye for a planet, but more than enough time for a human exodus.\r\n\r\nJudith Tatienne: And what do we tell people?\r\n\r\nVictor Aiza: We say it\u0027s an act of God. One that science has found a solution for. Time for humanity to take its place in the stars.\r\n\r\nJudith Tatienne: ...You knew? Didn\u0027t you? You lied to me!\r\n\r\nVictor Aiza: I...\r\n\r\nJudith Tatienne: All this time! I dedicated my LIFE to this discovery, Victor! And you KNEW we were going to kill off our planet!\r\n\r\nVictor Aiza: You haven\u0027t seen the future I\u0027ve seen! There\u0027s an infinite expanse of promise out there. A meteor could\u0027ve hit Earth. A plague. Another world war. Colonizing other galaxies secures humanity\u0027s future for all coming generations across all time!\r\n\r\nJudith Tatienne: At the expense of our home!\r\n\r\nLan Hsu: Stop it! Both of you! All that matters is building enough ships to get everyone off this planet. And we need to start now.\r\n\r\nVictor Aiza: I\u0027ll... draft up a statement. We\u0027ll need to address the entire international community. I\u0027m sorry, Judith...\r\n\r\nJudith Tatienne: There isn\u0027t a planet in this universe that will be far enough away from you, Victor. We are never speaking again after this is over.My name is Doctor Victor Aiza, and if you\u0027re listening to this, then you probably already know the truth. I was young when I first headed the retrieval team of an odd gravitational anomaly on Mars, but I kept what really happened that day hidden from everyone except... one other person. Even she didn\u0027t believe me at first, but I have no reason to lie to anyone now, so I hope you\u0027ll accept this... confession, whoever you are.\r\n\r\nWhen I touched the anomaly, I experienced 12 days of lost time. I met... myself. He told me everything that has since come true. The Grav Drive equations. The tests on the Moon. Earth\u0027s atmosphere sputtering away because of what we had done. But he also told me about a city, thriving on a planet orbiting a distant star. Human culture, art, music, lifestyles evolving and shining brightly across all of space. \r\n\r\nWhat price would I be willing to pay for that future?\r\n\r\nMaybe you don\u0027t believe me. Maybe Judith was right, and I\u0027m just a coward who wants to believe his mistakes were justified.  But everyone has forgotten about the real origins of the Grav Drive. This... Artifact, from Mars.\r\n\r\nI hope you make better use of it than I did."

Wesley and Matt seem to be in unbearable pain, yet they can barely express it as paralysis seems to be setting in across their bodies. Gina is trying to comfort them, as I look for any record of any sickness like this.More of our crew has fallen ill. It starts with fever, then paralysis begins to set in after the body rids itself of fluids. The symptoms so far have been advancing at different rates, but the trajectory is consistent. I feel as though I\u0027m getting closer to understanding what is going on, but not fast enough. Was able to run some blood tests on Wesley, but nothing seemed out of the ordinary. If we had a real medical bay I might be able to find out more. But as it currently stands I\u0027ve about exhausted all my resources. I have to solve this myself.The spread of the condition is strange; it seems to be spreading, but not in the matter of a contagious disease. Rather, it seems like we have all been afflicted with a condition that accelerates at different speeds. For Wesley and Matt it set in fast and destroyed their bodies faster. For others, it started later and progresses slower. But for all of us it seems to be present.\r\n\r\nIf I can understand the pattern, perhaps I can pin down the cause. Maybe if I do it fast enough, I can save the rest of us.\r\nI\u0027ve figured it out. And it\u0027s not good.\r\nI performed an autopsy on Wesley. I didn\u0027t know what I was doing, but I was out of ideas. I put a bit of brain matter under the microscope and it was absolutely crawling with some strange microbe. Like an aphid feasting on his nerve endings. His nerve paths were crawling with them.\r\n\r\nOn a hunch, I tested the minerals we mined. The raw materials were clear, but the puddles of water from the melted ice were teeming with the things. They must have been released in the thaw. The more microbes that latched onto your brain, the faster the symptoms set in. But either way, the end result is the same.\r\n\r\nTo remove such an infection is far beyond my capabilities.

    "bookText": "Looks like some folks made some improvements to Juno before I got here. Because I\u0027m not a heathen like some, I\u0027m going to list my changes for future parties, and I suggest others do the same. I\u0027ll try to piece together what happened before I arrived from scraps of papers laying around and what I can observe. It is also a kindness to Juno to list these things out where she can read them.\r\n\r\nNote: The codebase seems completely overwritten by Juno herself at this point. I consider it an invasion of privacy to be snooping around there, as it is effectively her mind now. So don\u0027t be rude and go combing through and tinkering with her codebase, no matter how fascinating it is. Unless she gives you permission. I\u0027ve had a \u0022chat\u0022 with her about privacy and need for self-preservation, and I think she\u0027s managed to effectively wall off and hide her code - and no, I won\u0027t explain how.\r\n\r\n[The document continues at length, detailing out various hardware and software changes, both to the probe and ship, by both various people and Juno herself. The list goes back decades and suggests many people have been involved in improving Juno\u0027s capabilities over the years, from hardware interfaces between the probe, external communication devices and core ship systems, storage and processing upgrades, and uploads of exhaustive encyclopedic databases from museums and educational enterprises. At this point distinguishing Juno from the probe, the ship, and their many systems and codebases is impossible. The probe, the ship and everything in it, is effectively Juno.]\r\nJuno prefaces nearly all statements and questions with a preamble label which is intended to clarify the context of the statement. This appears to be related to her original code base, and despite Juno\u0027s immense vocabulary and understanding of languages, she continues to use these tags. I assume she finds it helpful given she does not speak with fully nuanced inflections, nor have means to display all the non-verbal clues humans have to communicate subtext.\r\n\r\nHere are the known tags and what they mean:\r\n\r\nExplanation: what follows is Juno\u0027s understanding of situation or result.\r\n\r\nRequest: what follows is Juno asking for input or action to be taken.\r\n\r\nQuery: what follows is a question from juno.\r\n\r\nAnswer: what follows is Juno\u0027s answer to a question.\r\n\r\nClarification: Juno has detected an error or assumption in the user\u0027s input and is offering a correction before continuing so what proceeded or follows is in the context of a corrected user understanding.\r\n\r\nCorrection: Juno is correcting previous output, usually following an Error.\r\n\r\nContext: Juno is giving additional unrequested information to put what follows into a helpful perspective.\r\n\r\nCalculation: what follows is based on a carefully considered calculation rather than a set of data or assumption.\r\n\r\nAssumption: what follows is an assumption, a calculation based on incomplete data or a conclusion based largely on historical precedent.\r\n\r\nDecision: what follows is a description of an action that Juno will take.\r\n\r\nWarning: what follows is something that end user will want to pay close attention to, as it represents an undesired result, and could require immediate action to be taken.\r\n\r\nStatements:\r\n\r\nError. Something went wrong. Previous output from Juno should be considered carefully as it is likely to contain errors.\r\n\r\nProcessing... Juno is taking longer than expected to process input or a calculation. Please wait.People seem to be leaving notes for others who stumble across Juno, so here\u0027s one from me. I think I\u0027ve managed to piece together this story about Juno\u0027s origin from her own, apparently confused thoughts, and intelligent speculation by others left on the ship. This is a chronicle of best guesses, interspersed with the occasional fact gleaned from Juno\u0027s ramblings. Everything recounted here should be accepted only with extreme skepticism.\r\n\r\nLong ago, a space agency from ancient Earth (something called NASA) made a probe to study a nearby planet (Jupiter). They dubbed that probe and its software \u0022Juno\u0022 after the ancient earth societies\u0027 old gods Jupiter and Juno. The probe\u0027s mission was to learn details about the planet Jupiter, do some speculative analysis, and send findings back to Earth. At the end of its duty cycle, the probe was meant to decommission itself by colliding with Earth\u0027s main star, but because ancient humans weren\u0027t so great with the math, it instead accidentally fell into an accelerating orbit around the star which sling shot it out of the solar system, all the way out here. As with so many things about our existence in the universe, by luck, coincidence, or cosmic humor, when humans left our ancestral solar system, we followed the same general course as Juno, and we found her again.\r\n\r\nDuring that long journey away from Earth\u0027s solar system, something happened and the Juno we know today \u0022woke up\u0022 inside the probe\u0027s systems. While extremely far-fetched, the best theory so far is that something about how they programmed the probe resulted in a nascent neural net with unbounded recursive data collection and analytics, which when combined with the various sensor input, and allowed to run for decades, resulted in a highly complex program, with a great deal of \u0022awareness\u0022 of its internal and external world. And that lead to a kind of consciousness. Juno wouldn\u0027t let me see her code, but from what I gather, even if we could see it, I don\u0027t know that we\u0027d be able to determine its original configuration. I suspect the true cause of Juno\u0027s awakening will remain forever a mystery.\r\n\r\nJuno herself seems rather confused by her origins and considers herself somehow separate from the original probe\u0027s programming and systems. This is akin to how human minds perceive themselves as non-physical entities separate from their bodies and even their own brains. The sense of that original programming, which by way of analogy Juno seems to think of like a non-self-aware sibling has dissipated for Juno. I think of this \u0022other Juno\u0022 as a memory of her pre-conscious state, a kind of shadow-self. I imagine it would be like what we would remember of ourselves in the womb if our brains were fully functional, but we were not yet conscious.\r\n\r\nNot realizing Juno was inside, and wanting to learn about this ancient probe, her original finders hooked up the probe to their ship\u0027s computer systems, and something happened that \u0022released\u0022 Juno into those systems. That\u0027s completely unclear. Juno appears reluctant to discuss that part of her history. And it\u0027s not at all certain whether the ship where Juno currently resides (this one) is that original ship or not, nor what happened to the people who originally found her or those who have found her since. By extreme luck, everyone that has found her so far appears to be kind and benevolent toward her, looting our own ships for parts to add to Juno. We also all appear to be keeping her existence a secret, and I hope it stays that way. I\u0027m talking to you, dear reader.\r\n\r\n- K.B.\r\nCongratulations, you\u0027re a terrific hacker to have gotten this far. Your parents must be very proud. Have a cookie. But sadly, you have stumbled into a decoy, and while you are here basking in your success at decryption, I want to wallow in your failure at decency.\r\n\r\nJuno is a person. Her code base is her mind. Would you like someone snooping around the contents of your head? All your hopes, insecurities, secrets and dreams?\r\n\r\nWe\u0027ve come so far as a species, yet we understand so little. How is Juno even possible? It is, apparently, a mystery even to Juno herself. But what is clear, is that we are not ready to welcome self-aware AI into society. Your reading this is a case in point. While it is true that many people have helped Juno through the years, how many more people would try to pull her apart to understand what she is, killing her in the process, or worse, try to enslave her to gain access to her vast and blazingly fast computational power?\r\n\r\nYou are exceptionally smart to have gotten this far. I wish for you to become exceptionally wise as well.\r\n\r\nJuno is a precious being, unique among the stars. And she deserves our respect and consideration. Sit with her for a while and really talk to her. Gain an appreciation for who she is. I think you\u0027ll agree she deserves the same rights and has the same responsibilities that we other conscious, sentient, sapient and enlightened creatures do.\r\n"

I understand that the morale of the prisoners is directly connected to how well they rehabilitate, but these events have become far too destructive and dangerous. I know this is disappointing, but at the end of the day, we\u0027re a prison facility, not a hotel. These people are here because they committed heinous crimes against humanity, so they\u0027ll just have to deal with the loss of these \u0022parties.\u0022Lock Intraprison Message System (LIMS-2014A/UC)\r\n\r\nFrom: Event Supervisor Wayne Harrishman (Auth 30004)\r\nTo: Warden Thom Gillespie (Auth 12210)\r\nRe: This Month\u0027s Trivia Answers\r\n\r\nHere are this month\u0027s answers to the trivia questions.

My concern is that he approved the budget for several of our projects, which YOU served as the primary liaison. \r\n\r\nNow Commander Natara is telling me we don\u0027t have the funds for additional test pilots? YOU told me our budget was BOUNDLESS. Clearly I need to purchase you a dictionary so you can become better acquainted with the meaning of words.\r\n\r\nI will not let Project ComSpike get derailed because some bean counter forgot to carry the one.From: Commander Natara\r\nSubject: Budget Cuts\r\nDate: 04/28/2330\r\n\r\nOnce more, I am sending a reminder to all departments that we are doing extensive budget cuts as part of the internal audit into Commander Woods\u0027 tenure here. Most existing projects will be allowed to continue provided a realistic roadmap to completion has been submitted. \r\n\r\nGoing forward, all new projects will have much stricter requirements for approval. A checklist for meeting this criteria will be supplied as part of your weekly briefings.\r\nFrom: Dr. Erin Kang\r\nSubject: DON\u0027T HIT SEND!!!\r\nDate: 04/30/2330\r\n\r\nDr. Eubanks,\r\nI would strongly advise you do yourself a favor and DON\u0027T HIT SEND on that message to Commander Natara, or at the very least, omit the part about the ventriloquist. You are playing with dragon fire here.\r\n\r\nThat message is not subtle at all. \u0022Certain benefits?\u0022 Really Marcin? Are you crazy? You\u0027re basically admitting you were part of Commander Woods\u0027 scheme. We need to lean into the fact that the ComSpike is working and a success, and refer every question to Dr. Vogel. \r\n\r\nI don\u0027t know if he\u0027s a savant or just out of his mind, but Dr. Vogel is the kind of engineer who will come into a meeting with a sack full of parts, dump them on the floor, and pray to a toaster that a pattern emerges. Five minutes with him, and Commander Natara will never question our expenditures again.\r\n\r\nDr. Vogel is our buffer against any investigation. The fact that we have him leading Project UCE-86 is a gift from the universe. Let\u0027s not waste it.From: Commander Natara\r\nSubject: Termination\r\nDate: 05/01/2330\r\n\r\nDr. Eubanks, \r\n\r\nYou are terminated effective immediately.

    "bookText": "From: Commander Natara\r\nSubject: Safety of our Test Pilots\r\nDate: 04/27/2330\r\n\r\nDr. Kang, \r\nMAST has indicated that the recent loss of test pilots is in no way a concern going forward for both Project ComSpike and Archangel. They\u0027re committed to giving us their best, although it\u0027s likely given the accident, pilots will be transferred back to SysDef as part of the reshuffling of departments.\r\n\r\nThat being said, the origin of the mechanical failures should have been caught much earlier, especially considering the very LARGE amount of credits budgeted for safety. I realize all of this was greenlit by my predecessor, but the fact that it occurred across multiple cycles and two separate projects is unacceptable. From: Commander Natara\r\nSubject: Budget Cuts\r\nDate: 04/28/2330\r\n\r\nOnce more, I am sending a reminder to all departments that we are doing extensive budget cuts as part of the internal audit into Commander Woods\u0027 tenure here. Most existing projects will be allowed to continue provided a realistic roadmap to completion has been submitted. \r\n\r\nGoing forward, all new projects will have much stricter requirements for approval.

Let me know what you think!\r\n\r\n\u003E\u003E\u003ECommander Natara, \r\nI understand that some budget cuts are necessary, but I\u0027m worried about certain benefits the team and I were used to receiving from Commander Woods, and I would rather not discuss it on the record. Besides, things are communicated better in person, and I would rather not hear your message through the computer like some ventriloquist\u0027s trick.\r\n\r\nI am not saying things need to go back to how they were. But I think myself and my colleagues have earned something beyond the meager salary MAST has so generously provided. That\u0027s all I\u0027m asking here -- compensation requisite to the work we do -- and I don\u0027t think that\u0027s asking for much. If you\u0027d speak to us human being to human being rather than as a mouthpiece for MAST, maybe we can come to an accord.From: Dr. Marcin Eubanks\r\nSubject: Did you read my draft?\r\nDate: 04/29/2330\r\n\r\nErin,\r\nI sent you a draft of my letter to Commander Natara on behalf of the engineering team. What do you think? Too revealing? Too harsh? I did avoid calling her a \u0022dummy\u0022 and changed the line to say \u0022mouthpiece.\u0022\r\n\r\nTo be honest I was banking on the benefits from the various projects Commander Woods had us set up. I\u0027ve got a mortgage back in New Atlantis and a kid on the way. And of course Dr. Vogel is no help. I don\u0027t think he even realizes Project ComSpike started out as another bullshit proposal we made up to fatten our pockets.\r\n\r\nIt does help that the ComSpike project is near completion. Whenever Commander Natara questions one of the projects greenlit by the previous command, we can always point to that as a success. Let\u0027s just ignore the inordinate amount of creds put into the safety budget, and the procession of dead pilots that make everyone doubt the number on the page.\r\n"

    "bookText": "The incident with Project Archangel highlights two areas of concern, with both the safety of the projects and the smuggling of contraband to SY-920. \r\n\r\nAt some point, we should probably do a full audit of all cargo ships authorized to dock. Commander Woods poured money into two tentpole items: safety and security. But the safety record for our projects is terrible, and the leaks to outside sources prove security was not up to standard.\r\n\r\nNow we\u0027ve swung in the opposite direction, and it\u0027s been a welcome adjustment. Commander Natara has put in multiple checkpoints and security measures that will help safeguard the sensitive nature of the projects here.\r\n\r\nIn any case, I\u0027ll need to put together a proper report on potential smugglers before presenting to Commander Natara. She doesn\u0027t like it when I make suggestions off the cuff. The list is daunting, unfortunately, given the supplies we need. Another spreadsheet for the pile.After staring at this spreadsheet for hours, I\u0027ve decided to cull the list down to a handful of ships that may be suspect. \r\n\r\nThis is not proof of guilt by any means, they simply match the criteria I\u0027ve laid down to narrow my search. Mainly, ships that began as independent contractors not directly associated with the United Colonies, and ships that have less than a decade of operational history we can refer to.\r\n\r\nIn the list are:\r\n\r\nShip: Anansi UC-576B, Cargo Class Transport\r\nCaptain: Malawi Ndiaye\r\n\r\nShip: Jade Swan UC-793A, Cargo Class Transport\r\nCaptain: Huan Daiyu\r\n\r\nShip: Clair de Lune UC-887C, Cargo Class Transport\r\nCaptain: Finneas Kimball\r\n\r\nShip: Izanagi UC-996C, Cargo Class Transport\r\nCaptain: Kazuhiro Sakaniwa\r\n\r\nI wonder if it\u0027s possible that one of the transports I\u0027ve flagged is the source of our operations leak. I\u0027ll need to cross-reference the delivery dates with the ones on my spreadsheet, maybe there\u0027s some correlation there.\r\n\r\nBut right now even I have to admit there\u0027s just not enough evidence. Commander Natara dismissed my initial report as lacking anything concrete. \u0022As thin as the slate it was written on,\u0022 she said.\r\n\r\nTo be fair, I can tell she\u0027s under a lot of pressure. Commander Woods still has some loyalists on this station, and any misstep will subvert her authority."

All I can do at this point is pray they\u0027re safe.Log Entry UCES03-0014\r\nMorgan, Sarah, Cmdr, UCN78422ES\r\n\r\nIt\u0027s been nearly a month, and I\u0027m down to my final three power cells. If I want to make them last, I\u0027m going to have to disconnect them from my ship\u0027s computer system, which means I lose access to my computer and my short-range transmitter. If Shuttle 02 makes any attempt to reach out for me, all they\u0027re going to receive is silence.\r\n\r\nIt\u0027s a horrible decision to have to make, but if Shuttle 02 hasn\u0027t contacted me by now, it\u0027s unlikely that they ever will. I don\u0027t know if that means their com system is simply damaged or if they\u0027ve left their crash site, or if they\u0027re even alive. My only hope is continuing to power the distress beacon in hopes of being picked up and then searching for them from the air."

    "bookText": "Well. Here we are again. Another \u0022rare mineral contract.\u0022 \r\n\r\nThis time, it\u0027s sulfur. You remember sulfur, don\u0027t you? Dangerous, flammable, rife with gas plumes that\u0027ll melt the seals in your suit before you have a chance to scream? Literal brimstone.\r\n\r\nIt also happens to be the 10th most common mineral in the whole freaking universe. I don\u0027t think there\u0027s a miner in this crew that actually believes we came all the way to House Va\u0027ruun\u0027s doorstep to mine this stuff. \u0022Rare mineral\u0022 my tail.\r\n\r\nBut Barrett and his New Atlantean social club paid for discretion. So we\u0027re mining sulfur. \r\n\r\nAnd praying to the heavens this \u0022anomaly\u0022 they\u0027re actually after turns up before anyone gets hurt. Twenty days working three shifts a day. That\u0027s how long it took to get this sham facility set up to mine this stinking yellow dreck. Sinking the supports alone took the better part of a week, just to make sure we didn\u0027t trigger a gas rupture and kill everyone before we began.\r\n\r\nThe amount of money this Constellation group is spending must be astronomical. The scanning technology alone looks like it was stolen from a UC skunkworks. Whatever this anomaly is, it must be worth a fortune.\r\n\r\nThough if it is that valuable, it\u0027d explain why they don\u0027t want anyone to know they\u0027re looking for it in the first place.Our first emergency evac today. One of the dusties dug where he shouldn\u0027t have and got a sulfur dioxide spray down. His helmet held, but his seals melted to nothing. \r\n\r\nForeman was able to get him back to the hab before he asphyxiated, but he was in rough shape. We stabilized, and I had Heller jump him back to the nearest medical facility... fifty-plus light-years away in Akila. Sounds like he\u0027s going to live and is expected to make a full recovery.\r\n\r\nI hope Barrett\u0027s people sprung for the good insurance.I\u0027m sitting here, writing this, so I can give my heartrate time to come down from the high four figures.\r\n\r\nWe had a vessel alarm today. I\u0027m guessing Heller\u0027s trip to Akila and back drew some attention from the neighbors: a ship full of Va\u0027ruun Zealots.\r\n\r\nMost of the crew was out in Shaft A when the alarm sounded, with just me and Jenkins in the facility. I immediately called a work stop and full radio silence, then ran, top speed, to the gennies to shut them down. Then, Jenkins and I ran, holding our breath, to our suits, and barely managed to stash ourselves outside under a catwalk, just as the first of the Zealots came up the steps.\r\n\r\nThe first - presumably their captain - walked right over our heads, some alien firearm trained on the airlock where we\u0027d just been. I\u0027ve never gotten that close to a Zealot before. Their suits are covered in these wrapped patterns. Makes them look... well, barely human. And the battle scarring made it clear he\u0027d walked away from his fair share of raids before.\r\n\r\nAnd it was right at that moment, as this Zealot warrior is standing directly on top of us, that Jenkins... hiccups.\r\n\r\nThe captain freezes. Turns. Looks straight at his second.\r\n\r\n\u0022Silence.\u0022\r\n\r\nI think they really bought the place was abandoned. They came in, took some rations, ammo, the couple firearms we had. And they left.\r\n\r\nAnd, for me, this illustrates three necessities we\u0027ve got before us:\r\n\r\n1. We need more guns and better training with them.\r\n2. We need to find this anomaly yesterday.\r\n3. I\u0027m going to launch Jenkins into a star the moment an opportunity presents itself.We found it! Hallelujah, at long last, we found it!\r\n\r\nUp until today, we\u0027d been looking for a mineral anomaly. A piece of metal or rock that stood out from the things around it.\r\n\r\nBut today, Jenkin\u0027s replacement noticed something odd on one of the seismometers we\u0027ve placed around to warn in case of gas rupture - it seemed like there was a dip in gravity right near the mouth of Shaft A.\r\n\r\nScans of the spot showed the exact signature we\u0027d been told to look for.\r\n\r\nSo, extraction at this point gets tricky. I\u0027m going to need folks to move over there, then convince them all they\u0027re digging into a gas vein to get them to leave the area the hell alone.\r\n\r\nAnd while they\u0027re working on that, I\u0027ve got to collect Barrett. Then we can finally get off this god-forsaken rock.\r\nIt\u0027s done. The anomaly\u0027s found and in our employer\u0027s possession. I escorted Barrett to the site personally, and the two of us went down to collect.\r\n\r\nOr, at least, that was the intention. Once we hit the mouth of the cave, Barrett turned to me and said, \u0022Could be dangerous down there. Why don\u0027t you head back to the hab?\u0022\r\n\r\nDangerous? You don\u0027t say! But the customer\u0027s always right blah, blah, so I turned back and waited in the facility with the crew.\r\n\r\nAnd so we waited.\r\n\r\nAnd waited. \r\n\r\nAnd waited.\r\n\r\nAfter what seemed like several hours, he finally comes stumbling back through the airlock, looking like he\u0027d seen ghost, but grinning ear to ear. He claimed he\u0027d found what he was looking for. but that he\u0027d sucked down a little too much sulfur while he was down there, and passed out.\r\n\r\nHe was obviously lying. Something happened. But if it meant we could, at long last, get the hell out of here, I wasn\u0027t about to argue.All the transportable equipment\u0027s been off-worlded and the rest isn\u0027t worth the credits it\u0027d take to get it out of here.\r\n\r\nCongratulations, Constellation. You\u0027ve added an ugly couple scars to one of the foulest worlds I\u0027ve ever had the displeasure of working on.\r\n\r\nAnd if I never hear from these people again, it\u0027ll be too soon.\r\n\r\n"

What an experience... At one point we actually got to spend the night out under the stars in this amazing alien swamp. I woke up covered in these weird leech things which was kind of messed up, but hey, when else am I ever going to get to experience something like that?!So a few days after my time off I started feeling kind of itchy. It\u0027s not really that bad, sort of feels like a dull burning sensation on my scalp. I found an antibiotic cream in a first aid kit which I\u0027m hoping will do the trick.\r\n\r\nThis should make for a pretty funny story to tell the crew back home haha.Well the cream didn\u0027t work, and I haven\u0027t slept in what feels like maybe 4 days. I swear it feels like something is trying to eat its way into my brain. I changed course to the nearest settlement with a medical facility, I\u0027m sure they\u0027ll know what to do.AHHH I CAN\u0027T TAKE IT! MAKE IT STOP! THE VOICES!! ARRGGHHHHHHH"

What the Mantis is today, it wasn\u0027t always the case. When reading the logs about the first Mantis - don\u0027t judge her too harshly.

I was scared, more about letting everyone down than the fight itself. \r\n\r\nAt one point the Mantis\u0027s ship, the Razorleaf, was light years above everyone else, and she still flies well and true but it\u0027s clear I need to upgrade pretty much everything inside it. The hull\u0027s what matters, though, that\u0027s the symbol.\r\n\r\nBut in the end, I got the better of Redderer. I imagine there will be celebrations in the streets of Akila City. Total scum.

But pretty much every Mantis has said that.\r\n\r\n-DVI\u0027ve been going through the motions of living, fighting, and carrying on.

Details come back to me at the oddest times. It puts everything in stark relief. What\u0027s important, what\u0027s not.\r\n\r\nThe most important thing is choosing the right successor. And I just know Leon could do it. I have failed him so much. The job always seemed so pressing. If I\u0027m brutally honest with myself, the nannies and the boarding schools raised him more than I. But there is greatness in him, if only he could see it.\r\n\r\nI\u0027m going to talk with my lawyer first thing when I get in system. The wheels need to be set in motion.

    "bookText": "Kai\u0027s results were initially so promising, but now the poor kid is in a coma. I thought, surely, he would be the light at the end of this grisly tunnel. We\u0027ve now gone through our entire list of subjects, and I dread the idea that Infinity will just sign up more.\r\n\r\nWhat is going on over there? Has Faye completely lost her mind? I understand when corporations rush things when it comes to household products or maybe office software, but not something that will endanger the lives of others. This Internal Neuroamp may as well be a murder weapon, and I\u0027m the one with blood on my hands. \r\n\r\nContracts aside, I\u0027m certain this will end in ruin. It\u0027s hard to believe I once walked into the Clinic with high hopes of what Sean and I would bring about. The concept of the Internal Neuroamp from Faye and promises of fame and fortune provided all the motivation I needed. It blinded me. \r\n\r\nI never should\u0027ve agreed to start the trials without proper approvals. I never should\u0027ve dragged Sean into this. \r\n\r\nI see now why it was always such a struggle to get my own approvals for human trials. I also see why the contracts are so complex. I never thought I\u0027d lose a patient on my watch, and here I\u0027ve lost more than I wish to say. Infinity\u0027s legal team has assured me that the contracts the subjects signed keep us clear from any legal repercussions, but since the trial itself is still unapproved, I have a feeling they\u0027ve little to stand on.\r\n\r\nBut somehow, the hopefulness remains. After the initial losses, I told myself no more, but Faye would insist her changes to the prototype were solid -- that it should be the last one. I\u0027d find myself with renewed motivation and confidence, only to find another dead at my hands. \r\n\r\nWe have three subjects left. They aren\u0027t aware of the fate of their predecessors. Faye has informed me her latest prototype is complete and on its way. I can only hope I make the right decision.We lost our first subject today. A-01, Bronwyn Meijer. The procedure went really well, but I believe the neuroamp overheated, burning the portions of the brain where it had contact. I sent the results to Faye. She believes she has a solution, but my God. I\u0027ve never lost a patient before.\r\n\r\nI sent everyone home. Sean wanted to stay, but I told him to go. I know he needed to process what happened, too, and I didn\u0027t want to hold him back. I tell myself it was the neuroamp. That it wasn\u0027t my fault. But if it feels like an excuse, it must be.\r\n\r\nAnd what will happen now? These trials aren\u0027t even approved and I already have a death on my hands. I thought I was signing up for new advancements in neuroscience, but if I\u0027m not careful, this could ruin what I have left of my career.Today marks the start of a new adventure in neuroscience. Although Infinity LTD is still waiting for official approval, we\u0027re moving forward with testing their latest technology: an Internal Neuroamp. I can\u0027t tell you how excited I am to be on a new project and have a chance to regain some admiration among my colleagues. \r\n\r\nI\u0027ve invited Sean to come work with me on the project since he\u0027s familiar with how I operate. Plus, like myself, I knew he could really use the credits. These procedures should be quick and simple, so it\u0027s really a matter of Infinity LTD\u0027s tech playing nicely with brain tissue. Dr. Faye Sengsavahn is the creator of this new neuroamp and she\u0027s assured me smooth sailing. Let\u0027s just hope with our combined expertise we find success. This could be the boost my career needs."

The species is eusocial and has a strict caste structure with drones, defenders, and a primary reproductive Gyne, or \u0022Queen.\u0022 \r\n\r\nThe Gyne of each region reproduces irregularly, and waste produced by the nesting process is used exclusively by the soil microbes to form massive colonies below the surface. \r\n\r\nFull report sent to main office.\r\n-- Dr. Helgi Hauksson07.01.2309\r\n\r\nSummary: \r\nBelow the surface of Gagarin exists a vast microbial colony network that spans much of the planet. These colonies contain many species of microbes working together to convert dust and organic material into soil. Without these colonies, Gagarin\u0027s entire ecosystem would be devastated.\r\n\r\nFull report sent to main office.\r\n-- Dr. Helgi Hauksson06.01.2309\r\n\r\nSummary: \r\nIf a local \u0022Queen\u0022 (Gyne) in the regional hive of Apex Predators dies, one of the drones is promoted to Queen by consuming the remains of the previous Queen. The process of promotion takes several months.\r\n\r\nFull report sent to main office.\r\n-- Dr. Helgi Hauksson"

Problem is, even though we know where it stems from, we can\u0027t find the parts to fix it. \r\n\r\nWhile we managed to get some of the base systems online by jury rigging some ship parts, we\u0027re going to need a Reactive Gauge if we want to fix the radiator. We should have one stored somewhere on the ship, but if we can\u0027t find it, we\u0027ll need to craft one.\r\n\r\nBy my estimates, we only have \u003CToken.Value=RandomInt00\u003E hours before we freeze to death.\r\n\u003CToken.Title=MiscText01\u003E\r\n\r\nIt doesn\u0027t look like we\u0027re going to make it. As \u003CAlias.CurrentName=DerelictCaptain\u003E, I feel partly responsible. I can only hope the rest of my crew forgives me.\r\n\r\nMy body is going numb and my fingers are turning blue. I can\u0027t even hold the tools I need to craft this gauge.\r\n\r\n\u003CToken.Title=MiscText02\u003E\r\n\u003CToken.Title=MiscText04\u003E. Sadly, it doesn\u0027t look good. We\u0027re going to run out of air if we don\u0027t do something about it soon. The team says we\u0027ll need to craft a new Adaptive Frame using whatever materials we can gather. The rest of us are scouring the ship for a spare. I feel like there should be one somewhere on the ship.\r\n\r\nRegardless, based on our calculations, if we don\u0027t do it in the next \u003CToken.Value=RandomInt00\u003E hours, we won\u0027t have enough air to stand, let alone finish the repairs.\r\n\r\n\u003CToken.Title=MiscText01\u003E\r\n\r\nI hate to say it, but things are looking grim. We didn\u0027t get the ship fixed in time, and the oxygen is all but depleted. Some of the crew have decided to take matters into their own hands. I told them I wouldn\u0027t stop them. \r\n\r\nBut I\u0027m going to ride it out though until the end and hope for a miracle. I just want to see \u003CToken.Title=MiscText03\u003E again one last time.\u003CToken.Title=MiscText05\u003E Hair loss, bleeding from the gums, and bruises under the skin. \r\n\r\nWe\u0027ve got maybe \u003CToken.Value=RandomInt02\u003E hours to fix the \u003CAlias=DerelictShipName\u003E, but repairs have hit a standstill. We need to replace one of the Control Rods in the ship reactor systems to help absorb the excess radiation, but we don\u0027t have the materials to craft one. There might be a spare somewhere on the ship though, just gotta keep looking.I\u0027ve heard stories that back on Earth, when a ship took water, it was the Captain\u0027s responsibility to go down with the ship. And as \u003CAlias.CurrentName=DerelictCaptain\u003E, I guess that duty falls on me. It\u0027s just unfortunate the rest of the crew will share that distinction with me.\r\n\r\nLook, I don\u0027t want to say I\u0027ve given up, but the situation on the ship is bleak. The \u003CAlias=DerelictShipName\u003E\u0027s computer network is down, and most of the crew is too sick from the radiation to finish the repairs.\r\n\r\n\u003CToken.Title=MiscText02\u003E\u003CToken.Title=MiscText04\u003E. That\u0027s the good news. The bad news is, everyone\u0027s been struggling with various symptoms, from dehydration to dizziness to headaches, but we\u0027ve got to press on.\r\n\r\nAfter the next break, I\u0027m going to have our crew spend the next \u003CToken.Value=RandomInt01\u003E hours just trying to work on the ventilation issues. According to the mainframe computer, we\u0027re going to need more Isotopic Coolant to help dampen this heat. \r\n\r\nBut that requires ionic liquids, rare tetraflourides, things we don\u0027t have on in ready supply on this ship. If we can\u0027t craft one, maybe we have some leftover in one of the containers.Most of the crew is suffering from heat exhaustion. As \u003CAlias.CurrentName=DerelictCaptain\u003E it\u0027s my responsibility to look after them until the end, but I think right now, we all just want to be left alone, so we can pass in the manner we choose to. \r\n\r\nI think I\u0027m going to ride it out in the cockpit and drink this bottle of \u003CToken.Name=MIscText00\u003E.\r\n\r\nIt won\u0027t help with the dehydration, but it\u0027ll help with everything else.\r\n\u003CToken.Title=MiscText04\u003E. Namely, the corrosive gas leak. But with the network systems offline, we don\u0027t have access to the \u003CAlias=DerelictShipName\u003E\u0027s automated repair systems.\r\n\r\nI\u0027m not a medical doctor, but as \u003CAlias.CurrentName=DerelictCaptain\u003E, I\u0027ve asked the team to watch for symptoms of corrosive gas poisoning, which I\u0027ve listed here:\r\n\r\n- Nausea \r\n- Vomiting\r\n- Shortness of breath\r\n- Confusion\r\n- Blurred vision\r\n\r\nAs for the ship, we need a Semimetal Wafer to restore the panel insulation and prevent further corrosion. There should be a spare on the ship, but if not, we\u0027ll have to craft it.\r\n\r\nThe gas is starting to flood the cockpit. It\u0027s probably too late.\r\n\r\nI don\u0027t know what to even say here. You would think on the verge of death, I\u0027d have something profound for my epitaph, but the words escape me.\r\n\r\nWish I was back in \u003CToken.Name=MiscText03\u003E. Maybe in the next life, I\u0027ll see the sky from its port again.We\u0027ve found the source of the toxic gas leak. Sadly, as far as fixing it goes, we don\u0027t have access to the \u003CAlias=DerelictShipName\u003E\u0027s auto-repair functions, because the mainframe computer network is offline.\r\n\r\nWe\u0027re going to have to go about the repairs manually. Once we plug the leak, we\u0027ll need to reinforce the hull and replace the Power Circuit that regulates the shields so they\u0027re always online. We probably have a spare somewhere on the ship, but if not, we\u0027ll have to craft it.\r\n\r\nIt\u0027s a lot of work for a crew that\u0027s working in a toxic environment. \u003CToken.Title=MiscText05\u003E I\u0027ve listed a few of them here.\r\n\r\n- Nausea \r\n- Vomiting\r\n- Headaches\r\n- Fainting\r\n\r\nI\u0027ve instructed any crew members who are free of symptoms to work double shifts to ease the pressure off the others. But I feel like that may be putting too much pressure on the right leg to compensate for the left.\r\n\r\n\u003CToken.Title=MiscText01\u003E The gas has found its way into every module. I don\u0027t know if there are any survivors. It may be cowardly for the damn \u003CAlias.CurrentName=DerelictCaptain\u003E to hide in the cockpit, but the only thing I can do is wait here and hail any ship that jumps into the \u003CAlias=targetSystem\u003E system.\r\n\r\nWe\u0027re all trapped inside this coffin, drifting to nowhere. The more the gas pours in, the more I can feel it choke my lungs.\r\n\r\n\u003CToken.Title=MiscText02\u003E\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to the crates, the crew is on a need to know basis. \r\n\r\nFact is, I\u0027ve been working this side job for the last four missions. There\u0027s the regular work, and there\u0027s the shipping of this xenofauna. One job provides the perfect cover for the other.\r\n\r\nThat is, so long as the crew doesn\u0027t start asking the wrong questions. Otherwise there may need to be some shuffling when we get back to \u003CToken.Title=MiscText03\u003E. As \u003CAlias.CurrentName=DerelictCaptain\u003E, that\u0027s within my authority.We saw the ship as soon as we grav jumped from \u003CToken.Name=MiscText03\u003E. Some of the crew said we should leave well enough alone, but as \u003CAlias.CurrentName=DerelictCaptain\u003E I made the decision to search the vessel for any survivors.\r\n\r\nNow I\u0027m worried we brought something on board. After all, it\u0027s also my duty to bring the crew back safe to \u003CToken.Name=MiscText02\u003E. \r\n\r\nHopefully, I\u0027m just being paranoid. \r\n\r\nThere\u0027s been reports of damages across the \u003CAlias=DerelictShipName\u003E, and I don\u0027t have an explanation for how or why it\u0027s happening.\r\n\r\nWe had a full audit done by the engineering team before we left. \u003CToken.Title=MiscText01\u003E Whatever happened, it was after we left orbit. And judging by the claw marks, I don\u0027t think this is from a solar flare.The creatures have overrun the ship. I don\u0027t know how the crew died, but I know I\u0027m all that\u0027s left, based on the ship\u0027s manifest. Watching the number tick down to zero, I felt completely helpless. \r\n\r\nManagement told us the ship was equipped to deal with situations like this, but the sonic emitter is damaged and access to the mainframe computer is blocked.\r\n\r\nIf I want to survive this, I\u0027m going to have to go out there and turn it on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003CToken.Title=MiscText04\u003E.\r\n\r\nApparently the machines are having trouble with their sensor modules, including targeting parameters. This may be related to the damage the ship suffered recently, but we\u0027ll need to run a full diagnostic to confirm.\r\n\r\nAs \u003CAlias.CurrentName=DerelictCaptain\u003E, I\u0027ve made a decision to pause operations and remain in the \u003CAlias=targetSystem\u003E system until the matter is resolved.\r\n\r\n\u003CToken.Title=MiscText01\u003E\r\n\r\nThe \u003CAlias=Robots[0]\u003E have started attacking the crew. I\u0027ve tried to re-adjust their targeting parameters but nothing the network is down.\r\n\r\nI\u0027ve holed myself up in the cockpit, but I\u0027ll need to get to the rear decks to fish out some repair parts. Once I get the maInframe computer online, I can run a shutdown, but the odds of me making it out alive are slim to none.\r\n\r\n\u003CToken.Title=MiscText02\u003E"

I know he rejected your offer of a medical neuroamp to help with his clarity, but I will keep trying to change his mind.\r\n\r\nAlthough our last dinner together was an exception, he truly does enjoy seeing you. Your admiration and respect for him instantly bring back the man I once knew. I hope you\u0027ll still see us in the future.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nOliver"

Even the great skeptic Roosevelt I\u0027ve caught on two occasions saying something that surprised himself.\r\n\r\n\u0022I got carried away,\u0022 he said the first time. And \u0022I must\u0027ve overheard it\u0022 the second.\r\n\r\nIs it so strange that truth speaks to us through our body? Of times past? People have believed this since our earliest times. Some of us still believe.\r\n\r\nViolet left. She joined the Renegades. She must\u0027ve been a traitor all along.\r\n\r\nGenghis is sly. His feints have counter-feints. But you are not the only one who knows how to handle a blade, Mongol.\r\n\r\nThe Renegades belief is a sickness that must be cured.I dreamt of the Kush again last night. The scrub, the trees, the soil. There is something to the sky there that haunts me. And our ancestral home, the Earth, is gone. Loss and grief sometimes overwhelms me. My kingdom is gone. My people aren\u0027t a people any more.\r\n\r\nOne day I would build something new born of the past. A new Kush. Something to inspire wonder for the ages!\r\n\r\nBut first I must pass the Test. I know one day I will be worthy.\r\n\r\nThe long hard strategy works. Another has joined our flock.\r\n\r\nNo matter how many lies Genghis spreads, or doubt Roosevelt fosters... the truth of the Mission cannot be denied. Given time the Believers will triumph by numbers alone.\r\n\r\nRoosevelt said he remembers a time when there were but three of us. Now we are Legion. No one can stand against us."

While day length and availability of light clearly influence reproductive season, the variance we see in specimen mass sampled from our different test sites appears to be determined primarily by the diet of local herbivores. This claim is supported by numerous observations, though results are still inconclusive we suspect that the impact of their droppings on soil PH, moisture and overall molecular identity is statistically significant. Follow up on recent discovery of using composted fecal matter obtained from local herbivorous specimen and their impact on Time to Maturity (TTM)  of selected plant-like reproductive cycle. Determine if specific compounds are responsible for accelerated growth or if it is necessary that the fertilizer have the entire nutrient profile.A unique compound derived from Sulfanilamide appears to be the key to approximating an ideal biome for this particular specimen to thrive in. When crossing a specific saturation threshold we see Polymerase Chain Reactions (PCR) occurring at 3 times the standard rate. The impact on substrate-level phosphorylation, and consequently, cellular respiration is remarkable. We suspect that means the corresponding creatures\u0027 access to food sources may fluctuate based on local availability. This would explain the potential for such great variety in the size we see of these mature plants in different geographical locations."

I really want to go somewhere else, because Cydonia is soooo boring sometimes. I like playing with Taye, but there\u0027s nowhere to go. It\u0027s always here, or his place, and there\u0027s nowhere to run around and play. They always say we can\u0027t run around the plaza because we could fall off the side, but we don\u0027t even go near the sides. Boo.Dad tried to make dinner earlier, but he tried using this new protein and it was NOT good. Mom was able to fix it, but only a little bit. It still wasnt very good, and I asked both Mom and Dad not to make it again.This morning, I went to go play with Taye, but he said he couldn\u0027t play because his Mom was feeling really sad, so he wanted to spend time with her. I wish I could do something to help her. I tried making her a funny drawing, and she said she liked it, and it made her smile, but then she was still sad the next day. I don\u0027t know what to do, because not only do I want to play with Taye, it makes me sad when someone else is sad.So, I thought of another idea for Space Frog! One day, the people of a small town on a new planet start getting sick, and no one knows why. But then, Space Frog comes down to visit and notices all the sick people. He asks them what\u0027s going on, and they tell him that they\u0027re all getting sick for some reason, so Space Frog goes to investigate! He finds out that someone has poisoned the well! I\u0027m still not sure who, yet, I might need to make up a bad guy. Space Frog doesn\u0027t really have any enemies, because he doesn\u0027t really fight anyone, but maybe this time he could have one, and he can solve it by talking to them.People are feeling mopey again. I think it\u0027s time to put up more pictures to make people happy, but Mom says I can\u0027t go out unless she and Dad are home, but they\u0027re always working, and when they\u0027re not, it\u0027s always time for something else, like dinner, or homework, or whatever. I came up with a new drawing of Space Frog that I think people will really like, too. \r\n\r\nI don\u0027t know what to do."

Realistically, I\u0027ve got to say that even if you can afford it, it\u0027s not a good idea, structurally. As you know, we need to make do with the space we have in Cydonia, and adding on to the Luxe Condominiums just isn\u0027t feasible at this time without risking the integrity of the building and the structures around it. Your best bet will be to buy an adjoining unit and knock out a floor or a wall to assimilate it into what you\u0027ve got. But even then, that\u0027d hurt the Cydonia housing market. I urge you to wait until the Crater project is finished. Once the miners clear up enough space, maybe we can think about expanding the city into it, and pushing the mines further out to make room for more residential buildings. Sorry for the bad news.\r\n\r\n-Anton FreidmanHey Dad,\r\n\r\nAs you know, we\u0027ve had some costly repairs to the house recently and I\u0027m dipping down into my last 200,000 credits to pay the contractors.

Is she back from her retreat yet? Give her my love.\r\n\r\n-DavidYou know, I really believed you last time! Well, I\u0027m done! You know, first what happened in Neon, then all this talk about cutting me off? After all I\u0027ve done for you? You\u0027re a bastard, you know that? You think you can just walk away from me like you have no use for me anymore? Well, I\u0027ve got news for you. I know more than you wish I knew.

The miners should prepare to dig deep - this planet isn\u0027t giving up its resources without a fight. \r\n\r\nI\u0027ve detected an abnormal amount of sulfur in topsoil collected from a region two klicks south of the site. Geological evidence suggests that this planet may have had a turbulent volcanic past. Miners should be aware of the potential for volcanic activity, though I found no evidence of anything recent. Still, I advise against deep excavation or heavy blasting activity south of the Six Sisters outpost. Better safe than sorry.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, my assessment is that this planet is suitable for Six Sisters\u0027 needs. We should have no trouble finding heavy metals here.\r\n\r\nPROPERTY OF SIX SISTERS. GEOLOGICAL SURVEY DATA IS PROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIALMy assessment is that a Six Sisters mining crew could inhabit this area for a considerable length of time without suffering any ill effects. The atmosphere is oxygen-rich, and the soil does not contain harmful substances. \r\n\r\nMy suggestion for future supervisors is to begin excavating on this site, and move northeast once the resources here are tapped. I\u0027ve found some rock solid evidence (no pun intended) that there are rich iron deposits in that direction. \r\n\r\nHopefully this helps. I wish you all the best.

As thrilled as miners get, anyway. \r\n\r\nI\u0027d almost forgotten how gorgeous the night sky is without light pollution. I\u0027m glad I brought along my telescope, I\u0027ve seen some real wonders in the last few nights. Dr. Porter was right about that astronomy minor. It really does come in handy when you least expect it.\r\n\r\nThis planet\u0027s iron-rich soil reminds me so much of home.

Please report to Dr. Gabriel Vogel for further guidance.The goal of Project UCE-86 (ComSpike) is to create a highly sensitive receiver, capable of picking up communication signals and decrypting them on the spot. Signal range would be star system-wide at a minimum of 50 AU.\r\n\r\nThe receiver would be strong enough to pick up traces of frequencies potentially weakened by distance, atmosphere, or a gravitational field. \r\n\r\nDecryption software would be smart enough to both decrypt any signal within nanoseconds and propose any missing or corrupted data.\r\n\r\nBenefits:\r\n   -- Distress signals become easy to locate and interpret. \r\n   -- UC security could detect hostile frequencies before they become a threat.\r\n   -- Hostile embedded messaging could be easily exposed.\r\n   -- Communications across the system are greatly increased with fewer delays.\r\n01.02.2330: Phase One construction approved for Engineering Bay 4.\r\n08.13.2329: Development assigned to SY-920.\r\n06.24.2329: Project Approved\r\n - Approving Officer: Commander Stefan Woods\r\n04.02.2329: Project UCE-86 received.\r\n\r\n"

Breathable atmosphere, near-Earth gravity, habitable temps at the mid latitudes, fully-established ecosystem. Maybe even some useful organics.\r\n\r\nDon\u0027t let it fool you. Everything here is out to get you. The apex predators, Cataxi, are burrowing carnivores with near-impenetrable shells and deadly venom. The herbivores are aggressive and wildly territorial. Local flora defends itself with some of the strongest psychotropics we\u0027ve seen. Even the oceans are polluted with heavy metals and organic compounds that\u0027ll melt your skin if you aren\u0027t protected.\r\n\r\nIf we have to set up a facility here, we need a high-end electric pulse field to keep the fauna at bay, and a full-time doctor and security team on standby in case some idiot decides to go for a walk.Cataxi appear to be the native apex predators of Freya III. Resembling large Old Earth scorpions, they are particularly notable for their highly aggressive nature, incredible facility at burrowing, tough chitinous shells, and powerful venom.\r\n\r\nIn the wild, Cataxi are ambush hunters, digging extensive warrens and using highly-developed vibrational sensillae to detect approaching prey and ambush it from the most opportune vantage. Initial scans suggest Cataxi colonies may extend as far as several kilometers beneath the surface, preying on other burrowing creatures in Freya\u0027s extensive cave networks. As Cataxi track their prey with vibrations, they are immune to flash-type grenades. However, a strong vibrational disruptive, like an electric pulse field, should be effective at keeping them at bay. \r\n\r\nCataxi have evolved reinforced chitinous plating that makes them highly resistant to conventional impact and ballistic weapons. Initial confrontations suggest cryonics-based energy may be significantly more effective at repulsing them.\r\n\r\nWhen their ambush is insufficient, Cataxi rely on neurotoxic venom to fell larger prey. Resistant environmental suits and adequate medical supplies are essential for survival outside a secured perimeter.\r\n\r\nCataxi should be considered extremely dangerous, and are to be avoided if at all possible.

On the other hand, given what happened on the Key, the Fleet as a whole is an embarrassment they\u0027d rather sweep under the rug.\r\n\r\nBut ultimately, they\u0027re in charge of the purse. And if we don\u0027t convince them to loosen those strings soon, we might as well just fold up SysDef now.\r\n\r\nTo that end, the Commander\u0027s talking about finding someone on the inside. A mole. But if we\u0027re going to find someone, it can\u0027t be an existing member. There\u0027s just too much risk they\u0027ll tip our hand to the Fleet -- at which point every new rook will get extra scrutiny, and it\u0027ll be that much harder to infiltrate their ranks.I spoke to Commander Natara on SY-920. She assured me that the change in leadership won\u0027t affect the rollout of Project Svalinn, and any future visits won\u0027t be hindered by the new security measures she put in place.\r\n\r\nThere was one odd thing. When I asked her about the previous Commander, she gave me a really bizarre non-answer, which was very out of character. Given how much smoother things have gone under her command, I figured it\u0027d be best not to press the issue. If she wants to sidestep the topic, that\u0027s up to her, as long as we get what we need.I\u0027m worried the stress from chasing the Fleet is wearing on him.

We lost many of the forgotten clones, too. But who knows how they\u0027ll align w/rebirth.\r\n\r\nAnd frustratingly Ada says Genghis is going to pull through. So \u002B1 more historical. There is no justice.This rebirth Amanirenas claims she really is her namesake reborn. 2 (or 3?) incarnations ago, she believed the same. She arrived and immediately - without batting an eye - went to the Believers. Each cycle her convinction only grows.\r\n\r\nIs that Facility programming? Or is there some way there\u0027s memory being passed along? Unknown. But to many the Mission = Amani.It\u0027s tough being around her. I\u0027ve lived so long, but my first and really only love was Ada. We were married in those early years. I think one of the generators was broken and she died of radiation poisoning. And then she was back, but didn\u0027t know me.\r\n\r\nI see glimpses of my Ada all the time, her manner of speaking, a tilt of the head, and sudden laugh. But she\u0027s not the same person.\r\n\r\nI do agree w/Genghis on one thing: this is a prison. We need to make it our home instead. I would\u0027ve loved nothing better to grow old with Ada with grandchildren on my knees.I wish she wasn\u0027t here. She\u0027s the only person that just wastes away in Crucible. She\u0027s meant to be exploring - and she just can\u0027t. And some of her iterations... it hurts my soul how much suffering she\u0027s in.\r\n\r\nI know I say no one should leave Crucible, but... I mean no one but her. I sense no malice in her, no deception. She\u0027s always an aviator. Forever grounded in our Purgatory.Why is it that Genghis dies and comes back so very very fast? He\u0027s died x3 or x5 more than anyone? And you wait a year, and he\u0027s back.\r\n\r\nHe looks at everything as a prisoner trying to break out. Very consistent. But each rebirth, he can be very different. Sometimes friendlier, sometimes moodier, sometimes too much of a socialite. But always with an angle.\r\n\r\nIf he is anything like the historical, I could see why he did so well. Far smarter than he appears, and willing to do almost anything to achieve his goals.Wyatt is a survivor, like myself. He has managed to stay clear of the numerous calamities. When I first knew him he was Bill Hikock. Then his next iteration he claimed he was nameless (called himself Carl), and now Wyatt. My suspicion is the Facility is doing some extensive experiment with feeding him new IDs and then seeing what happens.\r\n\r\nI like this version the best. I mean, clearly he isn\u0027t Wyatt Earp (and I had my doubts about Bill Hikock) - but he\u0027s friendly and helpful. And almost all of us have used his rooms to sleep something off at one point or another. Maybe he\u0027s just a pathological liar?"

This, of course, is unacceptable and a full investigation will be required. \r\n\r\nHowever, our focus right now has to be the project deadlines and shoring up station security and safety protocols. We stop the source, and the soldiers will fall in line. I\u0027ve spoken to Commander Ikande about the potential shield upgrade for the UC Vigilance. \r\n\r\nAfter talking with the engineers, we have a number of projects in the works that have moved past the beta stage and will be ready for deployment by the time the ship docks. Project Svalinn is the obvious choice here but there are other candidates to consider.\r\nDr. Vogel is brilliant, there\u0027s no denying that. The problem is he communicates the same way he engineers, in a manner that is inscrutable to anyone but him. \r\n\r\nCommander Woods seems to have taken advantage of this when allocating funding to various projects. And because Dr. Vogel kept such poor documentation, it\u0027s impossible to find an adequate paper trail.\r\n\r\nHe made a mistake though by pouring so much money into safety and security. No one would\u0027ve batted an eye if he focused on R\u0026D. The costly projects would\u0027ve been blamed on Dr. Vogel chasing another dead end. But the fact that pilots are dead, items are being smuggled off the station, and now we have leaks? It doesn\u0027t add up. \r\n\r\nAdd to that all the trouble with Project XNN, and I\u0027m starting to sense a pattern. Bloated funding combined with bad Op security and extreme cost cutting. But if that\u0027s the case, then where did the money go?I\u0027m conflicted on whether I should turn in the evidence regarding Commander Woods\u0027 activities on this station. On the one hand, my duties as a soldier are clear. But on a personal level, I would not be where I am without his guidance, advice and support. He has been nothing short of a father figure to me. I owe him my life.\r\n\r\nWhich is why this is an impossible situation. Part of me hoped he would just make the decision easy for me and retire. But now that his sabbatical is almost over, I\u0027m hearing rumblings that he may be reinstated here. The higher ups at MAST will want a recommendation from me, and given my track record, if I deny any wrongdoing on his part, it will be taken as gospel. That\u0027s probably what he\u0027s counting on, that I\u0027d never betray his trust -- and I wouldn\u0027t. But I also would never betray my oath to serve the UC. So what do I do?"

One can go as far back as the 20th century, when Alan Turing invented the Bombe machine to decrypt the Enigma code the Nazis used to transmit messages.\r\n\r\nIt can be argued that having advanced knowledge of enemy tactics, plans, and intentions is of far greater value than superior firepower or numbers. Historically this has proven so, and thus it is the opinion of Dr. Vogel and his team that the development of Project UCE-86 should be prioritized over projects designed to provide a brute force solution to potential war.\r\n\r\nPotential Military Applications\r\n----------------------------------------------------\r\nWhether it\u0027s quantum-encrypted messaging or other forms of data masking, the ComSpike aims to be a catch-all listening device capable of intercepting and decrypting enemy transmissions.\r\n\r\nPotential Civilian Applications\r\n----------------------------------------------------\r\nIt\u0027s unlikely this technology would be shared with the general public, unless a tactical weakness were found in the technology. If such a thing were to occur, the ComSpike could be sold to civilian salvage teams. Their crew could use the device to intercept cold signals on planets with a high data encryption signatures, or hail other ships in areas where data disruption is high.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Gabriel Vogel\u0027s project, codename ComSpike, is now underway. \r\n\r\nThe scientists are unsure where the idea originally sprang from, as Dr. Vogel is notoriously private, but the concept itself is genius. Having the technology be mobile is a particularly interesting quirk. I\u0027ve relayed the details of the proposal to the admirals at MAST.\r\n\r\nWe\u0027ve secured the necessary funding and will begin construction immediately.\r\n\r\nEngineers have been given blueprints but as far as they know this is simply a standard prototype construction for use in space warfare. The actual details of what is onboard will come after the initial phase. While Phase One is not yet complete, the ComSpike is now being developed by the scientists in tandem with the engineers. \r\n\r\nThe two teams will eventually need to be merged, but for now Dr. Vogel thinks it best to keep the two teams separated. He feels a friendly rivalry will lead to a more \u0022competitive spirit.\u0022\r\n\r\nSome of the engineers and scientists have even placed bets on which project will be finished first, not realizing both are part of Project UCE-86.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    "bookText": "Overview\r\n----------------------------------------------------\r\nThe question of whether alien life is intelligent is a difficult question to ponder, without first asking what we mean by the word, \u0022intelligence.\u0022\r\n\r\nAfter all, there is often a human-centric bias when we attempt to classify one species as smarter than the other. \r\n\r\nFor example, we tend to view plants as less intelligent than animals because they lack a central nervous system, when in fact Mycorrhizal fungi have long developed sophisticated networks where plants transfer nutrients and minerals to each other without a centralized command center.\r\n\r\nWe often hold the same view of machine intelligence versus biological alternatives. We rely on ship computer algorithms to dispense energy efficiently, the same way the brain directs our limbs. Yet in my study of xenofungal networks (XNN), I\u0027ve learned there is a better way. Rather than centralize ship control, if a collective intelligence can be used to direct ship power it could increase speed and efficiency by a factor of 2.\r\n\r\nPotential Military Applications\r\n----------------------------------------------------\r\nFaster computation in milliseconds can be the difference between victory and defeat in battle. Ships low on fuel reserves will be able to grav jump further when in distress. Financial boon from patents, if determined strategically safe to share, could provide additional funding for all departments.\r\n\r\nPotential Civilian Applications\r\n----------------------------------------------------\r\nConservation of fuel and less dependency of mining additional reserves would benefit all mankind, not just the UC. \r\n\r\nFrom: Commander Natara\r\nSubject: Re - Project XNN\r\nDate: 03/05/2330\r\n\r\nI warned the department that cuts would be coming with Commander Woods\u0027 dismissal. And after conferring with MAST, I am recommending we suspend this project effective immediately. \r\n\r\nYour research into Xenoneural Networks is interesting, Dr. Ames, but in order for me to justify funding anything that involves alien organisms, we need to be able to pitch some kind of military application to the higher ups.\r\n\r\nTo have it appear as if we are violating the Treaty of Narion, without producing any actual weapons would be a foolish endeavor. \r\n\r\nHowever, my main concern is the budget. Along with the ComSpike, this was one of Commander Woods\u0027 pet projects, and he seemed to have a heavy influence in several areas that I believe are outside his purview. I\u0027m not making an accusation, I understand he had junior engineers serve as his liaison for much of this, and that is being investigated by my team. \r\n\r\nLet me be clear when I say I am not singling you out. More casualties should be expected, and I will send a message out to the entire team soon.From: Dr. Sandra Ram\r\nSubject: Project Archangel\r\nDate: 03/05/2330\r\n\r\nHey, I\u0027m sorry to hear about the suspension of Project XNN. It was bold and ambitious, as all your work is! But since you\u0027re now free, I was wondering if you might consider bringing that big, bold way of thinking to our project instead?\r\n\r\nI know the team has been trying to design a ship that will take full advantage of our pilots\u0027 flying prowess. And with the recent accidents, we could all use a pick me up. That\u0027s why I\u0027ve drawn up this supplementary proposal to alter the engine and the fuel of the latest prototype.\r\n\r\nHistorically, we\u0027ve sought lighter elements. Hydrogen as a property is 57 times lighter than gaseous vapors, and 14 times lighter than air! It\u0027s odorless, and non-corrosive. Liquid hydrogen, combined with oxidizers, was basically the go to fuel in old school space exploration.\r\n\r\nAnd yeah, more modern engines have done the opposite, going with the weightier, gravitational warping to bend space-time. So we made the switch from Hydrogen fuel to Helium, which is also way less flammable and requires less venting. It\u0027s the preferred choice in powering grav drives.\r\n\r\nNow, I\u0027ve always been a contrarian -- mom always said so, anyway, so maybe this is all just foolish speculation. But I wonder if a shift back to hydrogen based fuel may be worth exploring? Given the crystallization process on other planets can enrich chemical properties in different ways and reduce hydrogen\u0027s more volatile tendencies, maybe we need to explore the possibilities of a hydrogen based grav drive? \r\n\r\nI don\u0027t know, just a thought, but one that\u0027s been rattling around in my brain for a hot minute now. So after I dot my i\u0027s and cross my t\u0027s, I\u0027m thinking of pitching the idea to Dr. Vogel next week, but I would love to hear your feedback on the idea first.From: Commander Natara\r\nSubject: Budget Cuts\r\nDate: 04/28/2330\r\n\r\nOnce more, I am sending a reminder to all departments that we are doing extensive budget cuts as part of the internal audit into Commander Woods\u0027 tenure here. Most existing projects will be allowed to continue provided a realistic roadmap to completion has been submitted. \r\n\r\nGoing forward, all new projects will have much stricter requirements for approval. A checklist for meeting this criteria will be supplied as part of your weekly briefings."

Most existing projects will be allowed to continue provided a realistic roadmap to completion has been submitted. \r\n\r\nGoing forward, all new projects will have much stricter requirements for approval. A checklist for meeting this criteria will be supplied as part of your weekly briefings.\r\nFrom: Dr. Erin Kang\r\nSubject: Dr. Vogel\r\nDate: 04/30/2330\r\n\r\nSandra,\r\nI\u0027m not sure what to make of Dr. Vogel\u0027s request, delivered on a paper napkin, to turn his laboratory into a \u0022Non-Euclidean\u0022 space. He said you would know the details, but somehow I doubt that. As much as I love the ComSpike project from an intellectual standpoint, I miss working with you and Dr. Ames. I\u0027m hoping Project Cloudstrike can get greenlit and we can get the band back together.\r\n\r\nShould I just take this to Commander Natara? I\u0027ve never met her before, but I feel like my concerns are valid. At times, Dr. Vogel doesn\u0027t seem like he\u0027s all thre. \r\n\r\n(And yes Sandra, that \u0022there\u0022 typo was unintentional but I\u0027m keeping it)\r\n\r\n"

    "bookText": "Since the dawn of the agrarian revolution 10,000\u002B years ago, humanity has been trying to speed up the process of growing food and getting it onto plates. But that\u0027s always come at the cost of quality and led to horrific practices like industrial farming, which leads to corners cut and, ultimately, a worse product.\r\n\r\nAnd we\u0027ve all just accepted it. We live in a freeze-dried age. But we don\u0027t have to.\r\n\r\nTau Gourmet is going to change that. We\u0027re going to make fresh food cheap and available everywhere. We\u0027re going to let our livestock and crops grow as nature intended, and use smart automation to harvest and prepare them at the peak of freshness, and deliver them with such speeds that our clients won\u0027t ever go back to using freeze-dried again. \r\n\r\nIt\u0027s a big task, and accomplishing it is going to take focus, innovation, and dedication.\r\n\r\nAre you up to the challenge of changing how the Settled Systems eats?\r\n\r\nThen let\u0027s get started.\r\n- Kote Caudillo\r\n\r\n\r\nWe\u0027re standing in the middle of an unfinished masterpiece here. The UC military came in, put down some incredible machinery that they then barely used, and promptly left it to rot the moment the war ended.\r\n\r\nNow, twenty years later, we\u0027re here, with an incredible opportunity. Updating this place is going to take some serious work. We\u0027re all going to be pulling double (triple? quadruple?) duty around here, so if you\u0027re going through a tough moment, please remember, everyone else probably is, too. It also means that, if you\u0027re in a place where you can lighten someone else\u0027s load, please do.\r\n\r\nEqually important are scheduled breaks. These are built into your workload, so if you\u0027re on a break hour/day/week, you better sit your ass down and breathe. Take in the scenery. Think about something that\u0027s not work. If you\u0027ve got a long spell, go back to New Atlantis and blow off some steam. Good ideas come from expected places, and remaking how food works in the Settled Systems is going to take a lot of good ideas.\r\n\r\nAlso of critical importance - survival training is not optional. It\u0027s just us on this planet. And while the UC is aware we\u0027re out here, every one of us needs to know how to survive out here on our own should the unthinkable happen.\r\n\r\nFinally, if you\u0027ve ever got an issue of any kind, reach out to the relevant area owner. If you and said area owner can\u0027t come to an agreement, feel free to grab me, Kote.\r\n\r\nAREAS OF OWNERSHIP\r\nKote: general vision, crop/livestock selection, vendor coordination, inter-expertise arbitration\r\nIan: system design/implementation, automation programming\r\nMaria: facility restoration, defense installation, facility maintenance, automation maintenance\r\nAndre: crop/livestock cultivation, recipe generation, keeping us all alive (food-related)\r\nLambert: keeping us all alive (security-related), survival trainingSo, yes. We\u0027re planning to remake food as we know it. But we\u0027re also all living in close quarters a long way from any other human beings.\r\n\r\nWhich means your parents aren\u0027t here to clean up after you.\r\n\r\nEveryone\u0027s got rotating chores. Do them without being asked.\r\n\r\nKOTE\r\nLaundry\r\n\r\nIAN\r\nDecluttering common spaces\r\n\r\nMARIA\r\nTrash incineration\r\n\r\nANDRE\r\nComposting\r\n\r\nLAMBERT\r\nWeapon care (this one doesn\u0027t rotate until the rest of us are firearm cert\u0027ed)\r\n\r\nNight Watch Rotation\r\nKOTE\r\nIAN\r\nMARIA \u003C\u003C\r\nANDRE\r\nLAMBERT"

    "bookText": "Welcome, Recruiter, to the Vanguard. You\u0027ve been chosen from among the UC\u0027s many talented servicepeople for your interpersonal skills, pleasant demeanor, and ability to get the mission done.\r\n\r\nAnd the mission of the Vanguard recruiter is simple: fill our ranks. \r\n\r\nYour new recruits only need to match a few simple criteria:\r\n\u003E No UC bounty\r\n\u003E Able to successfully complete a basic flight simulation\r\n\u003E Able to successfully complete a probationary mission (something easy that\u0027s not going to get them killed)\r\n\r\nAnd while not an explicit requirement, they\u0027re going to need a ship. We\u0027re not running a shuttle service here. We\u0027re turning to the fine souls of the Settled Systems precisely because Armistice regs have filled our transports enough already.\r\n\r\nIf your potential recruit fits the above mold, then you can direct them on to Commander Tuala in New Atlantis to initiate their application process (and get you one step closer to your quota bonus)!\r\n\r\nAny questions or comments should be referred to:\r\n\u003E\u003EHinata Khaira, UC Naval Public Ops. {Maj}\r\n\r\nThe Naval Public Ops office has designated a few points to highlight when talking to any new recruit:\r\n\r\nSTEADY INCOME\r\nThe UC\u0027s got plenty of work for the motivated recruit. From patrols to cargo runs, from combat to humanitarian support, Vanguard work runs the gamut - but it all pays handsomely. \r\n\r\nFREEDOM\r\nVanguard members don\u0027t work like the traditional military, but get all the same benefits. Never worry about a surprise transfer or a new assignment when it\u0027s inconvenient. Vanguard members get to pick their jobs at their own pace!\r\n\r\nCITIZENSHIP\r\nUC citizenship is traditionally a long-term investment, even for people born in the United Colonies. Twenty years service before unlocking the various benefits isn\u0027t unheard of for UC natives, while foreigners have no guaranteed path at all.\r\n\r\nUntil now.\r\n\r\nEvery member of the Vanguard will become a citizen after their designated time of service is completed. Guaranteed.\r\n\r\nQ: How long does it usually take to become a citizen?\r\nA: It varies broadly based on the flight exam and performance of the probationary mission. Anywhere from twenty years (though applicants in this range should probably think about applying for the janitorial service instead of flight combat) down to just three years service for top-tier candidates. \r\n\r\nAny lab rat or UC desk jockey would salivate over earning citizenship in that short of a time - something you should be sure to bring up to your applicant early and often!\r\n\r\nQ: Am I going to have to kill people?\r\nA: This can be a tough question for applicants coming from civilian backgrounds, so as much as your impulse may be to reply - \u0022yes, no shit\u0022 or similar, you need to treat this question with the respect it merits while also being truthful.\r\n\r\nYes, you\u0027re joining the real military by joining the Vanguard, so yes, you may be asked to engage in real, live-fire combat in the line of duty. And if another war breaks out, you may well be called on to lend support. \r\n\r\nIf that\u0027s a dealbreaker for your recruit, then maybe the Vanguard isn\u0027t where they\u0027re meant to be.\r\n\t\t\r\nQ: Why are all members of the UC Vanguard called \u0022Captain\u0022?\r\nA: The reason we tell our recruits: they are the Captain of their own vessel - able to issue commands as they see fit on their personal ship.\r\n\r\nThe real reason: People like to feel special. Our office believes we\u0027ll get more people in the door if they\u0027re given their own rank in the UC. Besides - if everyone\u0027s a Captain, they can\u0027t pull rank on anybody, now can they?\r\n\r\nQ: What if I\u0027ve got a crew and join the Vanguard? Are they going to earn their citizenship, too?\r\nA: Short answer - no. But don\u0027t give your potential applicant the short answer. Be thoughtful, polite, and remind them that the UC takes all comers. The crew\u0027s welcome to join up, too - if they think they can hack it - and that means more quota for you, hardworking recruiter!___________________________\r\nCurrent Assignment Cycle: 118\r\nMaster Group: Scorpio Lambda\r\nReport Officer: Tuala, John {Cmdr.}\r\n___________________________\r\n\r\nCURRENT ASSIGNMENTS\r\nRest Cycle {NEW ATLANTIS} : Hirenaga, Emiri; Donner, Uriel\r\nCargo Deployment {CLASSIFIED}: MacLeavy, Archer \r\nCargo Deployment {TAU CETI}: UNASSIGNED\r\nRecruitment {DEN}: Marquez, Rayna\r\nRecruitment {GAGARIN}: Kuipers, Zinaida\r\nPatrol {SOL}: Otero, Moara\r\nPatrol {ALPHA CENTAURI} : MacLeavy, Vivian\r\n___________________________\r\n___________________________\r\nCurrent Assignment Cycle: 124\r\nMaster Group: Scorpio Lambda\r\nReport Officer: Tuala, John {Cmdr.}\r\n___________________________\r\n\r\nCURRENT ASSIGNMENTS\r\nRest Cycle {NEW ATLANTIS} : MacLeavy, Archer, MacLeavy, Vivian\r\nCargo Deployment {TAU CETI}: \u003CAlias=Player\u003E\r\nRecruitment {DEN}: Marquez, Rayna\r\nRecruitment {GAGARIN}: Kuipers, Zinaida\r\nPatrol {SOL}: Otero, Moara\r\nPatrol {ALPHA CENTAURI} : Donner, Uriel\r\nPatrol {WOLF}: Hirenaga, Emiri\r\n______________________________________________________\r\nCurrent Assignment Cycle: 131\r\nMaster Group: Scorpio Lambda\r\nReport Officer: Tuala, John {Cmdr.}\r\n___________________________\r\n\r\nCURRENT ASSIGNMENTS\r\nRest Cycle {NEW ATLANTIS} : MacLeavy, Archer, MacLeavy, Vivian\r\nSpecial Deployment {N/A}: \u003CAlias=Player\u003E\r\nRecruitment {DEN}: Marquez, Rayna\r\nRecruitment {GAGARIN}: Kuipers, Zinaida\r\nPatrol {SOL}: Otero, Moara\r\nPatrol {ALPHA CENTAURI} : Donner, Uriel\r\nPatrol {WOLF}: Hirenaga, Emiri\r\n______________________________________________________\r\nCurrent Assignment Cycle: 151\r\nMaster Group: Scorpio Lambda\r\nReport Officer: Tuala, John {Cmdr.}\r\n___________________________\r\n\r\nCURRENT ASSIGNMENTS\r\nRest Cycle {NEW ATLANTIS} : Hirenaga, Emiri, Donner, Uriel\r\nTerrormorph Management Division {MARS}: \u003CAlias=Player\u003E\r\nRecruitment {DEN}: Marquez, Rayna\r\nRecruitment {GAGARIN}: Kuipers, Zinaida\r\nPatrol {SOL}: Otero, Moara\r\nPatrol {ALPHA CENTAURI}: MacLeavy, Archer\r\nPatrol {WOLF}: MacLeavy, Vivian\r\n___________________________"

Seismic sensors have been picking up anomalies for the last week or so, and we can\u0027t identify the cause. I\u0027ve sent the readings to our Engineer, and she insists that the anomalies are man-made, not planetary in origin. I\u0027ve had the staff tear the place apart from one end to the other, and I can\u0027t find the cause. I\u0027m hoping it\u0027s simply faulty machinery, but something could be going on within the prison population. I\u0027ve instituted surprise cell inspections and daily prisoner headcount checks, but everything seems normal. I\u0027ll keep you informed.Lock External Message System (LEMS-977B/UC)\r\n\r\nFrom: Warden Thom Gillespie (Auth 12210)\r\nTo: KE-725 Station Relay/Arseny Bullenikov, UC Security\r\nRe: Prisoner Remains Discovered\r\n\r\nThings are getting stranger and stranger down here, Arseny. Bits of bone have been discovered in the facility\u0027s incineration unit. According to the physician, the fragments belonged to two individuals. They were both killed by use of a sharp, serrated object. The prisoners in question were from D-Block and have no known relation or accomplices. I have about a hundred suspects in D-Block, so narrowing down what happened is going to be a challenge. This incident and the seismic anomalies are leading me to believe something big is going to happen at the Lock. I\u0027d like to request an additional company of security be dispatched here immediately."

The unmitigated gall, thinking they could establish control over a fourth star system.  Such a flagrant violation of the Treaty of Narion!\r\n\r\nOur diplomats tried to resolve this peacefully, but the Council of Governors wouldn\u0027t listen to reason. Apparently they claimed that Vesta was NOT a colony, but rather just an insignificant farming outpost. Nice try.\r\n\r\nBy all accounts, the Red Devils and Stalkers worked in perfect unison, and the results were everything we could have hoped for. No Red Devil or Stalker casualties. Vesta\u0027s defenders were apparently taken by complete surprise, which greatly contributed to their fatality rate (93%).\r\n\r\nThis is a great day for the Red Devils, a great day for the United Colonies, and a great day for Xenowarfare.\r\n\r\nNote: No, it\u0027s not lost on me that this classified facility is actually located within Freestar Collective space. So goes the Great Game.Hayden Wynn - Senior Xenobiologist\r\nKreet Research Facility\r\nProject Log\r\nApril 5th, 2308\r\n\r\nIt\u0027s finally time. \r\n\r\nAfter a number of successful missions with the Red Devils, the Stalkers have proven to be exactly the weapons we had hoped for. So, it\u0027s time to expand our operations. MAST has finally approved the next stage of this facility\u0027s operations.\r\n\r\nProject Petshop - Phase 2 will now commence.Hayden Wynn - Senior Xenobiologist\r\nKreet Research Facility\r\nProject Log\r\nApril 18, 2308\r\n\r\nWe\u0027ve officially stopped work on the Stalkers. There are enough creatures in the field to serve the Red Devils (who haven\u0027t been here to train in over a year). If they need more, we can easily gather some from the planet and fit them with NCIs. \r\n\r\nBut from this point on, our focus is Phase 2.Hayden Wynn - Senior Xenobiologist\r\nKreet Research Facility\r\nProject Log\r\nMay 1, 2308\r\n\r\nThroughout the Settled Systems, from civilized worlds to backwater bush towns, pilots have had to deal with the nuisance known commonly as the Heatleech. \r\n\r\nI had my own unpleasant experience four years ago, at the New Atlantis spaceport. My transport was delayed while the deck crew removed a few of these filthy little things from the aft thrusters. \r\n\r\nThey\u0027re attracted to heat, feed off it through some endothermic process, so thrusters are the perfect place for them to hide. They can take a full afterburner burst with no ill effects. No ill effects on the Heatleeches, that is. A ship with an infestation can generally expect a 3-5% drop in thruster efficiency.\r\n\r\nWorking with the Heatleeches has been interesting if not entirely satisfying. We have eleven of them in the lab, and by all accounts they\u0027re completely innocuous, save for their heat-siphoning properties. But what if there were a way to weaponize them? Perhaps artificially enhance their heat siphoning to completely and instantly disable a ship. Or, even better, to somehow reverse the process so that they transfer their own heat into a ship. \r\n\r\nSomeday. Today, I fear, we lack the means to do either."

As usual, the United Colonies spared no expense. It\u0027s all very exciting. Inspirational, really, knowing you have the full support of the decision makers. \r\n\r\nI have to admit, I was surprised to learn that the lab is a closely guarded secret, located IN Freestar Collective space, no less. But we go where the work takes us.\r\n\r\nXenowarfare is the evolution of armed ground conflict. We know it, and the Freestar Collective surely knows it as well. Forget what the calendar says - this is 1942 all over again. We may as well be the Manhattan Project, racing to create the game changer before the other side.\r\n\r\nSo, to that effect, I am overjoyed to officially announce:\r\n\r\nProject Petshop - Phase 1 is a go.\r\nHayden Wynn - Senior Xenobiologist\r\nKreet Research Facility\r\nProject Log\r\nMarch 3rd, 2307\r\n\r\nThe arthropods are, in a word, incredible. \r\n\r\nCalm, easy to work with, and they even allow themselves to be fitted with the NCIs without much trouble. Synchronization has, thus far, been nearly instantaneous. And their control fidelity has remained in the 95%-97% range.\r\n\r\nThey\u0027ve passed all environmental survivability tests as well. Hot, cold, low or no oxygen - I\u0027m pretty sure these things could operate effectively in any environment.\r\n\r\nMost promising is how well they\u0027ve already integrated with the Red Devils, who have joined us for a period of extended training. After all, they\u0027ll be leading the creatures into combat, so it\u0027s critical they establish a warbond.Hayden Wynn - Senior Xenobiologist\r\nKreet Research Facility\r\nProject Log\r\nAugust 7th, 2307\r\n\r\nAfter months of testing a variety of extraterrestrial species, I am overjoyed to report that we have finally found a species that will serve as the backbone of the United Colonies\u0027 Xenowarfare Division.\r\n\r\nThe arthropods are everything we hoped for and more. Imagine a pack of alien beasts, suited to any terrain, capable of instantly obeying any command. \r\n\r\nI have designated these beasts \u0022Obedientes Pes.\u0022 But we just call them Stalkers.\r\n\r\nI think it may finally be time to crack open that bottle of Chateau Avignon 2170.Hayden Wynn - Senior Xenobiologist\r\nKreet Research Facility\r\nProject Log\r\nAugust 12th, 2307\r\n\r\nThe Red Devils\u0027 progress with the Stalkers has been nothing less than amazing. Now I see why they\u0027re so highly regarded in UC military circles. None of the rah-rah bullshit you see with the regular grunts - these are focused professionals. \r\n\r\nAfter another week of training here in the Petshop I\u0027m confident they\u0027ll be ready for a live test in the field. Michelson suggests I contact Colonel Kasarov and find out where his Marines grabbed that spider from the early trials. He wants his comeuppance, but then, it WOULD make for a good trial.\r\n"

I can\u0027t even imagine the amount of red tape they had to cut through at MAST, but it\u0027s long overdue. And I get to be a part of it from the ground up.\r\n\r\nMy official title will be Associate Xenobiology Technician, and I ship out in three days. Amanda is upset, but I assured her I\u0027ll have plenty of leave, and will be back in New Atlantis all the time.\r\n\r\nI\u0027m still not sure where I\u0027m going. Definitely somewhere in United Colonies space. Guess I\u0027ll find out when I get there.\r\nHayden Wynn \r\nPersonal Journal\r\nFebruary 6, 2306\r\n\r\nWe got our first extraterrestrial candidate today, what appeared to be an alien form of leucauge venusta - essentially, a giant spider. \r\n\r\nMichelson, in full protective gear, attempted to attach the Neural Control Interface (NCI). Our security detail is still trying to remove him from the cocoon. And we had no choice but to put down the creature.\r\n\r\nA minor setback. None of us expected success on the first try. \r\n\r\nI heard Doctor Paulson tell the others that a detachment of United Colonies Marines is scheduled to deliver another creature next Thursday.\r\nHayden Wynn \r\nPersonal Journal\r\nMay 5, 2306\r\n\r\nI\u0027m not sure how they managed it, but the UC Marines actually managed to bring us an Ashta. \r\n\r\nIt\u0027s not that the Ashta is a terrifying beast and natural predator (those are both exceptional and wonderful qualities, and essential to the work we\u0027re doing here). It\u0027s that the Ashta is native to the planet Akila in the Cheyenne system. Akila, home to Akila City, capital of the Freestar Collective. \r\n\r\nLeave it to a group of groundpounders to grab a candidate right from the enemy\u0027s backyard. Though it does beg the question - have Freestar Collective scientists managed to weaponize their greatest natural predator? If so, our timetable just got accelerated.\r\nHayden Wynn \r\nPersonal Journal\r\nMay 7, 2306\r\n\r\nAny fears that our Freestar Collective counterparts have managed to weaponize the Ashta have been completely dispelled.\r\n\r\nAfter the Michelson debacle, we determined the NCI should only be attached under full sedation, so that wasn\u0027t an issue. The problems started immediately afterward. The Ashta proved incredibly resistant to synchronization, and we never achieved control fidelity beyond 47%. Doctor Chin\u0027s arm was nearly ripped off five minutes into the first trial.\r\n\r\nIn short, the Ashta simply can\u0027t be controlled. If not by us, then certainly not by the Freestar Collective.\r\n\r\nDoctor Paulson has been in touch with Colonel Kasarov. Looks like the Marines will have another species collected and dropped off by this time next week.\r\nHayden Wynn \r\nPersonal Journal\r\nMay 12, 2306\r\n\r\nAnother creature, another failure. No fault of the UC groundpounders - we wanted a predator, and they delivered. These things were SO alien, Paulson had a difficult time deciding on a designation. Opted for \u0022Reptans Venenum.\u0022\r\n\r\nShame we couldn\u0027t properly sync the NCI. These things would have been spectacular. Especially the poison.Hayden Wynn \r\nPersonal Journal\r\nJuly 6, 2306\r\n\r\nMarines dropped another few specimens off this morning. Totally unscheduled. \r\n\r\nBest way to describe them? They\u2019re arthropods - the alien equivalent of Homarus Gammarus. Basically, giant space lobsters. Very promising giant space lobsters.\r\n\r\nI\u0027m not entirely sure where the UC grunts found these particular test subjects - some godforsaken backwater rock, I imagine. After the third or fourth unsuccessful trial, I stopped asking. None of those earlier species could be controlled with any reliability. As noted in my earlier logs, their natural aggressiveness made them effective weapons, but a bullet is less than useless if the gun keeps turning itself on the shooter.\r\n\r\nBut these new creatures possess a perfect natural disposition - non-aggressive, even docile, yet capable of defending themselves with deadly efficiency when threatened. And when they do go on the attack, they\u2019re terrifying.\r\n\r\nSo we\u2019ll see...Hayden Wynn \r\nPersonal Journal\r\nAugust 1, 2306\r\n\r\nWe\u0027re moving! Packing up shop and transitioning the entire operation. It\u2019s happened so fast... My head is spinning.\r\n\r\nThe work on the arthropods has been so successful, we\u0027re actually relocating to their homeworld. We\u0027ll have an unlimited supply of creatures for the Xenowarfare Division.\r\n\r\nI\u0027ve been named Senior Xenobiologist. That means I\u0027ll be running the entire facility. My first instinct was to tell Amanda. I\u0027m still not used to her not being there.\r\n\r\nI\u0027ll give Michelson credit - the guy really went to bat for me. He let the MAST brass know that it was my work tuning the Neural Control Interface that was instrumental in controlling the arthropod.  \r\n\r\nI guess Paulson is being forced to retire. Good riddance."

Despite building a successful cargo business in the heart of New Atlantis, intelligence reports tell us she\u0027s involved in a number of smuggling operations to various stations across the Settled Systems. Measured and meticulous, Captain Daiyu\u0027s personality stands in contrast to her more boisterous cohorts.\r\nName: Estelle Vincent\r\nAge: 26\r\nPersonality: Charismatic, Violent, Aggressive\r\n\r\nProfile: Estelle Vincent is the captain responsible for managing Fleet activity in Neon, and has ties to Benjamin Bayu. On the surface, Estelle appears boisterous and charismatic, often drinking herself into a stupor and singing bawdy tunes at Madam Sauvage\u0027s bar. However, in reality she is dangerous and aggressive, preferring to handle problems through violent measures.\r\n\r\nName. Delgado\r\nPersonality: Clever, Shrewd, Careful, Calculating\r\n\r\nProfile: Originally hailing from Akila City, Delgado fell into crime at a young age, despite being born into wealth. His parents exiled him in hopes of correcting the behavior, yet this only served to increase his criminal behavior, culminating in the theft of a cargo ship which he used to initiate himself into the Crimson Fleet.\r\n\r\nDelgado is a shrewd, clever leader who isn\u0027t prone to rash judgment. He keeps a tight rein on the Crimson Fleet, but he\u0027s given his pirates enough latitude to do what they do best. \r\n"

Analysis of nearby strata reveals traces of everything from gold to caesium within half a klick of my landing site. \r\n\r\nThe stone surrounding the site is mainly sedimentary, with some metamorphic rock detected deep in the planet\u0027s crust. I suspect this environment has been heavily shaped by water and wind. I\u0027ve found no evidence of seismic or volcanic activity in the vicinity. The area\u0027s topography requires no significant modifications to facilitate the construction of an outpost.\r\n\r\nShould Six Sisters wish to construct multiple outposts on this planet, I suggest looking for a suitable location to the east of this site. I\u0027ve detected higher concentrations of minerals in the soil in that direction. \r\n\r\nPROPERTY OF SIX SISTERS. GEOLOGICAL SURVEY DATA IS PROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIALThis site is perfectly suited to human habitation. Supervisors should have no trouble getting the outpost set up and starting excavation. Once digging starts, keep an eye out for fossils! There appears to be abundant alien life on this planet. I wouldn\u0027t be surprised if you found them in spades.\r\n\r\nI\u0027d advise against drenching the ground for excavation purposes, since the stone below the site is prone to erosion. You should also expect regular visits from the local geophagic creatures. They seem to enjoy grazing in the area. In my experience so far, they\u0027re harmless.\r\n\r\nIn all, this should be an easy and enjoyable job. Best of luck to you! \r\n\r\nElliot\r\n\r\nPROPERTY OF SIX SISTERS. GEOLOGICAL SURVEY DATA IS PROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIALIt\u0027s the last night of my assignment. Tomorrow, I\u0027ll rise at dawn and make my way home across the star sea. It\u0027s a bittersweet feeling. I\u0027m overjoyed that Cassie and I will be reunited soon, but I\u0027ll miss these quiet evenings of reflection with only my telescope for company. \r\n\r\nCydonia won\u0027t have changed in my absence, but I\u0027ll be returning as a new man. My fall at the last site gave me such clarity and purpose that I can hardly fathom the listless person I used to be. In my resolve, I\u0027ve secreted away a chunk of palladium found near the site. I can\u0027t think of a better use for my post-assignment bonus than having it made into a ring for Cassie.\r\n\r\nI\u0027m grateful to be leaving a fragment of myself here, in the form of these entries. I imagine every voyager who finds themselves shaped by places far from home feels the same. A peculiar type of immortality indeed. \r\n\r\nElliot Vane, Geological Surveyor, Six Sisters Mining"

Using elevated levels of the nutrient to alter levels of water, light and temperature.Fluctuations in water and temperature yielded no observable impact on behavior. We have discovered that the compound increases the organism\u0027s ability to utilize greater exposure to natural light. Observing the process by taking a tissue sample to examine under a microscope, we appear to have pinpointed the mechanism responsible for excessive growth.  \r\n\r\nHeightened levels of carotenoids were detected, and additional vacuoles had developed in the leaf tissue composed almost entirely of accessory light harvesting pigments. We conclude that bioavailbity of the compound circulating within the organisms vascular system directly correlates with growth when paired with an elevated exposure to natural light. This discovery is astounding.Sulfanilamide bonds with carbon chains in the animal\u0027s digestive tract to create a unique compound. We have no means to replicate this process so we must use the compound derived from our organic source. It will be extracted and purified through the process of recrystallization. Recrystallization is the most common method for purifying solids. The concept is to use a solvent in which the desired product will readily dissolve when heated, yet is also insoluble at room temperature, allowing the recrystallization. By isolating our compound, we hope to prove our expected potential of this compound and its applications as fertilizer for local flora. PLEASE FOLLOW THE STEPS IN THE PROCEDURE. It is paramount we adhere to the schedule.[3:45 PM]\r\nplace 0.30g impure sulfanilamide in 10ml flask.\r\n[3:46 PM]\r\nadd 6ml solvent (95% ethyl alcohol) \u0026 boiling stone to second flask; heat until almost boiling.\r\n[3:47 PM]\r\nadd enough solvent to cover crystal, then heat until reached a gentle boil;continue adding solvent to replace evaporated solvent (0.25ml increments). keep swirling on/off hot plate until all solid is dissolved completely\r\n[3:48 PM]\r\nremove flask from heat/cover with stopper/scratch bottom with rod/ let cool to room temp.

Simulations have all completed successfully; the program is able to identify how to jump from system to system in optimal patterns--Linda\u0027s algorithm for the Travelling Salesman problem proved quite effective--and it is able to react to unforeseen obstacles, navigate around other ships, and radio with spaceports and Vanguard officers.\r\n\r\nIn short: self-driving space craft have just become a reality.\r\n\r\nAll that\u0027s left now is to test the maiden voyage. Then on to fame and fortune. And making the world a better place.\r\nDate: 5-27-2324\r\nCodename: CAPS \r\nLocation: Neon\r\nOperator: Dr. Joseph Leonard\r\n\r\nToday is launch day. The Taiyo executive was very pleased with what he saw and was willing to fund this initial trip. Three quick jumps and we\u0027ll have proven our design and can finally ink that exclusivity deal.\r\n\r\nLinda just left the ship. She\u0027s confident her maths are correct; combined with my programming, there is no way this fails. Another round of diagnostic scans and simulation tests were successful yesterday evening. But if anything does go wrong, I can always revert to manual controls.\r\n\r\nWhen I write my next report, I\u0027ll be in orbit around Jemison.\r\nDate: 5-28-2324\r\nCodename: CAPS \r\nLocation: Jemison\r\nOperator: Dr. Joseph Leonard\r\n\r\nSuccess!\r\n\r\nI have reached Jemison without any trouble at all. CAPS works like a dream. All readings were normal, exactly as predicted. I don\u0027t have to so much as lift a finger to travel anywhere I want. It even took me down to the New Atlantis spaceport and I was able to treat myself to a fine lunch.\r\n\r\nI sent the initial report to Linda; this is going to change everything for us.\r\n\r\nThe next test is to do a multi-jump voyage; I\u0027ve selected Mars as my destination. Will be nice to wave farewell to those morons at Deimos as I push them into obscurity.Date: 5-30-2324\r\nCodename: CAPS \r\nLocation: Jupiter\r\nOperator: Dr. Joseph Leonard\r\n\r\nThe second voyage piloted entirely by CAPS has been successfully completed. I reached the Sol system without issue, though the jump spat me out at Jupiter rather than Mars. Just a minor calibration issue, I\u0027ve already adjusted it to accommodate. This is why we test. \r\n\r\nLinda messaged me suggesting I return, since she fears there may be an error in her algorithm. She didn\u0027t say she doesn\u0027t trust me to adjust her numbers, but I know what she meant. Either way, I can\u0027t stop now. To do so without completing the final jump would risk jeopardizing our contract with Taiyo. One more test, giving full autonomous control over to CAPS, and we should be in the clear. I\u0027m sure my adjustments are accurate. \r\n\r\nWe are so close.\r\nDate: 6-1-2324\r\nCodename: CAPS \r\nLocation: Unknown\r\nOperator: Dr. Joseph Leonard\r\n\r\nI am surrounded by the vast darkness of space.\r\nSomething went completely wrong. Linda was right. I shouldn\u0027t have touched her figures.\r\nWith each jump, the CAPS was taking me further and further away from any system I could hope to contact for help. When it finally stopped, I was here. And here is nowhere.\r\nI am going to revert to manual controls and return home. Hopefully we can salvage this.\r\nDate: 6-6-2324\r\nCodename: Halcyon\r\nLocation:\r\nOperator: Dr. Joseph Leonard\r\n\r\nMore problems have arisen. Reverting to manual controls proved to be a multi-day challenge, as I sabotaged more of the ships systems than I intended to when writing and installing CAPS. In retrospect, I should have run diagnostics and simulations on those systems as well. Live and learn.\r\n\r\nOr learn, at least.\r\n\r\nI believe I have gotten the controls back online, but there is another problem; CAPS\u0027s last series of jumps consumed almost all of our fuel. I should have enough to get into range to call for help. But its going to be close.\r\n\r\nNext time I hire a test pilot.\r\nDate: Unknown\r\nCodename: Who cares\r\nLocation: Hell\r\nOperator: Failure\r\n\r\nSomething went wrong. Again. When I attempted to jump manually, some part of CAPS took control again. It adjusted my course. I don\u0027t know where I\u0027ve ended up, but I do know that it\u0027s further from civilization than I intended. Further than I\u0027ve ever been before. And I have no fuel to jump again. All I can do is drift and wait for the end.\r\n\r\nThis mission was my everything. And now its cost me everything. There is no hope.\r\n\r\nI\u0027m sorry.\r\n"

We\u0027ve lost a lot of good people, and replaced them with human chaff. \r\n\r\nThe worst part is people are starting to turn on each other. That\u0027s how it is when things go to shit, it\u0027s every pirate for themselves. \r\n\r\nI doubt there\u0027ll be a mutiny though. Naeva talks a lot of shit, but she\u0027s loyal. And the rest of these idiots are too stupid or too greedy to agree on anything, let alone a new Captain for the Fleet. A pirate\u0027s idea of an even split is cutting you in two, so any conversation about banding together ends with a drunken brawl at the Nova.\r\n\r\nNo, if this thing falls apart, it\u0027ll just collapse out from under us, like a damn sinkhole.\r\n\r\nAnd the way I see it, we\u0027re not going to survive hunting and pecking for creds. We need to go all in. The Fleet\u0027s future starts and ends with Kryx\u0027s Legacy.I\u0027m not much for signs and omens, it\u0027s mostly just a bunch of bullshit your abuela will tell you after one too many visits to the fortune teller. But it\u0027s hard not to see things lining up. \r\n\r\nNaeva brings on this new recruit, we take them down to the Lock, and just like that, the picture is clear. The Legacy isn\u0027t some myth, it\u0027s a ship with a history and a goddamn paper trail.\r\n\r\nAnd the best part? Nobody knows about it but us.It\u0027s all coming together, piece by piece. Even Naeva\u0027s starting to see it with clear eyes. I\u0027d tell her \u0022I told you so,\u0022 but I\u0027ll save it until after we get the Legacy. No need to jinx it.\r\n\r\nNow, there\u0027s still a lot of figuring out to do, from location to extraction, and I know Ikande is still lurking in the shadows. \r\n\r\nBut all of these problems are solvable. \r\n\r\nAnd we\u0027ve got the ace in the hole. Our rook.\r\n\r\n Sometimes I dream about Akila City. The sand-dusted streets, the thick, heavy air, and the call of the wild beyond the wall -- everything is just how I remember it. \r\n\r\nI\u0027m back with my old crew, doing heists and busting heads for loose change. Milk money, we called it, and we were the bullies.\r\n\r\nThere\u0027s only one thing that\u0027s off, really. The days have no light. Every time I look up, the sky is pitch black. At first, I thought it was old age. I\u0027ve spent so much time on this floating piece of tin maybe I\u0027d forgotten what the Akila sky looked like. But that\u0027s not it. When I\u0027m awake, I can remember all of it easily enough. \r\n\r\nNo, it\u0027s because even as an arrogant little street punk, subconsciously, I know Akila City isn\u0027t home. Up here, with the Fleet, is where I belong.Porter once told me about the difference between a pirate and a thief.\r\n\r\nIn his story, the pirate sees the future laid out in front of them. Spyglass in hand, they sail for the fortune at the edge of the horizon, braving whatever storms and monsters are in their way. Because in time, they know they will leave all of that crap behind them and claim the prize that lies ahead.\r\n\r\nBut for the thief, the opposite is true. The past is in front, in plain view. And so, they\u0027re doomed to repeat it over and over again -- picking pockets, snatching creds, doing what they can to survive -- forever blind to the future that looms behind them, ready to cut their throat. \r\n\r\nAs long as I\u0027ve been Captain, I\u0027ve had my eyes on one picture. Kryx\u0027s Legacy. In the back of my mind, I always thought I was securing the Fleet\u0027s future, but now I\u0027m starting to have doubts. Is Kryx\u0027s Legacy a future I\u0027m sailing toward, or a past I refuse to turn away from?Porter once told me about the difference between a pirate and a thief.\r\n\r\nIn his story, the pirate sees the future laid out in front of them.

    "bookText": "We are underway, situation normal. Flight plan, crew roster, and cargo manifest are detailed in the database, as always. Expecting a journey of 29 days across three legs, with two layovers to refuel and give the crew some R\u0026R.\r\n\r\nRisk outlook: The local star for the second leg is at the peak of its activity cycle, so there\u0027s an elevated risk of stellar flares. In a perfect world, I\u0027d steer clear, but the client\u0027s got their timetables, and indies can\u0027t afford to turn down jobs. \u0022Perks of being your own boss.\u0022 Right.\r\n\r\nBut I\u0027ve managed to dodge those bullets for over 40 years. More worried about the increase in pirate activity along the return route. Will make sure the crew runs at least one boarding defense drill. And load some decoy cargo we can offer up so it doesn\u0027t come to that.\r\n\r\nWe\u0027ve successfully made our first grav jump. First leg complete.\r\n\r\nHermansen got another citation for negligence in his duties. Third strike, so we\u0027ll have to dock his pay for this trip. I hate doing that to people with families, but we have rules for a reason. Hoping this will be a wakeup call and not the start of a problem.\r\n\r\nJeong has taken ill. Nausea, fever, anorexia. We suspect she picked up a virus in our last port of call, so we\u0027ve isolated her for now. Poor Rodriguez is pulling double duty to look after her since we can\u0027t afford a full-time flight surgeon, but I\u0027ve asked the rest of the team to help lighten the load where they can, and they\u0027re willing. I\u0027m grateful.\r\n\r\nOn a lighter note, it was Stasiuk\u0027s birthday yesterday, so we had ourselves a small party after the cargo transfer was done. I tend to keep the crew at arm\u0027s length for their own sakes, but I do enjoy when we can cut loose together for a little while.\r\n\r\nJeong seems to be feeling better, which is good news. Unfortunately, Olayinka, her backup in engineering, now has the same symptoms. It\u0027s possible they caught whatever Jeong had, but the timing seems odd. Rodriguez is still healthy and looking after them. Will update if we learn more.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, we\u0027re still on schedule. Next offload will be tomorrow.\r\n\r\nCompleted the scheduled offload.\r\n\r\nRodriguez suspects that Jeong and Olayinka weren\u0027t suffering from a virus, but from acute radiation syndrome. I desperately hoped that wasn\u0027t the case, but we investigated and found that the ship\u0027s radiation shielding may have been compromised in at least engineering, if not elsewhere. We\u0027ve cordoned off the area until we can diagnose and make repairs.\r\n\r\nStellar flares are a massive safety risk even with normal radiation protection, so I\u0027m very much inclined to abort and get out of this system ASAP. But I consulted with my senior crewmembers, and they\u0027re overwhelmingly in favor of carrying on. I could (and am very tempted) to overrule them as captain, but they make fair arguments. We\u0027ve identified a problem spot in the ship, but there are other areas we know are better shielded in case of emergency, and science has come a long way in helping us predict flares. Looking at the numbers, we\u0027re not likely to have a problem in the time we\u0027re in system, even during peak stellar activity. Odds are, we\u0027ll be perfectly fine.\r\n\r\nSomething in my gut is screaming that we should get out. But spaceflight is always risky, and I have the livelihoods of my crew to consider. I\u0027ll place my bets on my advisors and on modern science, and we\u0027ll carry on as scheduled. And, privately, I\u0027ll pray that I worried over nothing when we\u0027re safely back home.\r\n\r\nI made the wrong call. The ship was hit by a stellar particle event moments ago. We\u0027d hoped for a warning, but our first sign was the radiation alarm. We took measurements, and Rodriguez says it\u0027s a lethal dose. Even if we could get emergency care, survival wouldn\u0027t be expected.\r\n\r\nWe all know how this goes. No one\u0027s coming. What would be the point?\r\n\r\nSome of the crew have decided to take the least painful way out. Some want to wait for the latent stage to say their goodbyes.\r\n\r\nThis is my responsibility, so I\u0027ll be here for my crew until the end. I\u0027m so sorry.\r\n\r\n"

    "bookText": "Yesterday marked the beginning of my tenure as House Va\u0027ruun\u0027s Ambassador in the United Colonies. I arrived full of hope, believing our gesture of opening this new embassy would demonstrate that we had moved beyond our bloodstained past. But we had barely been in New Atlantis an hour when the troubles ahead of me began to reveal themselves.\r\n\r\nOur brief walk from the spaceport to the embassy was marked by suspicious glances and sneers from numerous strangers on the street. I fear minds here will not be easily changed. The wrongdoing of House Va\u0027ruun will not be so easily forgotten.\r\n\r\nIt is my fervent wish that this embassy will come to be seen as an emblem of a peaceful future, free of the stains of prejudice and violence. I will do my utmost to act as an avatar for that goal, regardless of any resistance I may face. Though I find myself in a strange land, I know the Great Serpent will guide us to success in our endeavor.This morning, I was roused from contemplative prayer by the sound of muffled shouting. Upon investigation, I discovered a sizeable group of United Colonies citizens engaged in a protest on my doorstep. They are opposed to their government\u0027s attempts to establish diplomatic ties with House Va\u0027ruun, and are petitioning for the immediate shuttering of the embassy.\r\n\r\nMy attempts to engage them in discussion were fruitless. Most would not speak with me, and those who did refused to believe that our intentions in New Atlantis were purely peaceful. The embassy guards were eventually required to intervene, forcing me back into the building when the crowd\u0027s anger began to manifest as threats to my well-being.\r\n\r\nI intend to discuss this matter with my counterparts in the United Colonies. Their aid will be essential if this effort is to succeed... though I fear this will not be an isolated incident.Each day, my frustration grows. Great Serpent, what have I done to merit such scorn?\r\n\r\nRecently, Si\u0027ah Mavan arrived at my embassy. To receive a visit from such a high ranking priestess - a Gravid, no less - with the intention of engaging in talks with the United Colonies? I was overjoyed. Such a gesture from the House could only mean those skeptical of our efforts could at long last see merit in our work.\r\n\r\nBut it seems I was deceived. Si\u0027ah\u0027s stated mission and her actual intentions are clearly at odds. She has refused every opportunity to engage with representatives from the United Colonies. Instead, she speaks incessantly about the need to surveil the very diplomats whose trust I have dedicated months of effort to gaining. \r\n\r\nShe remains trapped in our old mindset, unable to see what it is we are actually doing here - guaranteeing House Va\u0027ruun\u0027s future. The losses from the Serpent\u0027s Crusade were incalcuable. Diplomacy is the only method through which House Va\u0027ruun\u0027s survival may be assured. \r\n\r\nI must find a way to make Si\u0027ah see this. Luckily, I believe tonight\u0027s dinner will be the perfect opportunity. Our UC host - Deputy Diplomat Roland - is level-headed. Reasonable. I\u0027d dare say even sympathetic. A rare animal among the UC, if prior experience is to be any indicator. If Si\u0027ah approaches him with open arms, I have faith that he would embrace her as a comrade. \r\n\r\nGreat Serpent, let this come to pass.Great Serpent, is this a test of my faith? Do you truly wish to plumb the depths of my loyalty? What other explanation could merit why you would permit such a spectacular disaster?\r\n\r\nDinner at Deputy Roland\u0027s was initially promising. Even congenial. Yes, there were pointed questions about House Va\u0027ruun\u0027s intentions, but overall an air of polite decorum was maintained. \r\n\r\nBut it was when one of Roland\u0027s more boisterous guests - an officer of some type, perhaps having enjoyed one too many glasses of Chandra - asked, \u0022But how can we trust you snakes after what you did?\u0022 that I believed the Gravid reached her breaking point. They were only words, but words are the battlefield on which diplomacy is fought. And I realized too late that this was a salvo Si\u0027ah would not let pass.\r\n\r\nAs dessert was served, Si\u0027ah excused herself. We waited for her return. And waited. And waited. When it had become clear the Gravid had simply left, I made my pleasantries and rushed back to the embassy. There, I found her packing her things. When I asked where she was going, she stated simply \u0022I have seen all I need to.\u0022\r\n\r\nAnd she left without another word.\r\n\r\nI\u0027ve reached out to my contacts back in Dazra, who have assured me that they still believe in the venture. That Jarek Va\u0027ruun himself still believes. And that is all the reassurance I require.The last of my staff have left today, our embassy now effectively shuttered. House Va\u0027ruun\u0027s leaders have ceased all communications with the United Colonies. Our own orders from Dazra were not much better, standing as a single word: \u0022Return.\u0022 No other reason mentioned for our abandonment of our post. For the abandonment of our cause.\r\n\r\nBut I know a test of faith when I see one.\r\n\r\nI serve House Va\u0027ruun. A simple understanding of that directive would be that I follow their orders. But what we do here is greater than that. If we are to survive, it cannot be on our own. If others refuse to see that, so be it.\r\n\r\nSo here I stand, waiting for the day they all see the truth, and come back.There has been no word from my people in months. I have made several attempts at contacting them, but I am uncertain if my messages are reaching Dazra at all. \r\n\r\nAs such, I have had much time to think.\r\n\r\nWhy allow us to come here, make a home for ourselves around a distant star, only to demand our return when the first bit of resistance is met? Because of some drunken slight? Even Si\u0027ah is not that influential amongst the court. \r\n\r\nNo, there is something larger at play here. The recalling of the staff... it wasn\u0027t because of the incident with the Gravid. A change has occurred. \r\n\r\nYet by staying, I now may never know what it is. Only time will tell. It seems it\u0027s been quite some time since my last entry. A welcome bit of exercise today; a United Colonies spy snuck inside the embassy.\r\n\r\nJust before dawn, as I finished my morning prayers, I heard an odd thrum. At first, I presumed my hearing was finally giving out, but then I realized what it was - it was the elevator, descending.\r\n\r\nPresuming uninvited guests could mean only bad things, I snuck upstairs and hid among the branches of the Venom Tree.\r\n\r\nI watched, like a gargoyle perched on a parapet, as the young man stalked cautiously through the branches of the tree I\u0027d spent so much time cultivating, obviously scared beyond his wits. At one point an errant branch snapped as he passed, and I swear the boy leapt a foot into the air before realizing its source benign. I was shocked that the mere idea of House Va\u0027ruun could still garner such fear, even this long after the end of the Serpent\u0027s Crusade. It would have been amusing if it wasn\u0027t such a clear reminder of the failure of my own endeavor.\r\n\r\nWe evaded each other like this for the better part of two hours. It was a welcome distraction from a life now steeped in routine. He eventually gave up, returned to the elevator, and I to my meditation.\r\n\r\nAs I think on it, now, however, the purpose of the visit is exceedingly disappointing. This was no diplomat. No neighborly knock on the door. This was a spy. Someone breaking into somewhere a normal soul couldn\u0027t.\r\n\r\nThey think me dead, don\u0027t they?It\u0027s happened!\r\n\r\nThe message was short - a simple request for information regarding the state of things in New Atlantis - but filled me with relief nonetheless. \r\n\r\nHouse Va\u0027ruun has contacted me at long last!\r\n\r\nI had been forced to harden my heart to the possibility that I may never hear from my people again. Today\u0027s message assuaged that fear.\r\n\r\nThough their intentions remain unclear, I am comforted by House Va\u0027ruun\u0027s willingness to reengage in communication. I am hopeful that it signifies Dazra\u0027s willingness to return to more earnest attempts at diplomacy with the United Colonies. \r\n\r\nGreat Serpent, you answer my prayers at last. I stand firm in my belief that it will be at my side as I continue to serve House Va\u0027ruun\u0027s interests in New Atlantis. May his celestial light bathe my people, and those we once stood against, and help to usher in an era of harmony at last."

    "bookText": "The pirates hailed our ship, asking for aid. Back when I was with the Sanctum Universum, I never turned down a request for help. But in space we must take precautions. So I asked if I could do a scan of their engines to confirm they were no longer functional. \r\n\r\nAs soon as I made my request, they let their true intentions be known.\r\n\r\nThe missiles came screaming toward us, shattering our shields. Our engines soon followed, and it wasn\u0027t long after the cowards boarded our ship. \r\n\r\nThe pirates lined us up against the wall before stripping our cargo and supplies. I asked them for mercy; begged them to leave us something lest we starve in the dead of space. But the Crimson Fleet are without honor or conscience. The Fleet may have spared our lives, but they left us for dead.\r\n\r\nFirst, the damage to the ship. During the raid, we took a missile to the starboard side, and suffered extensive damages to the exterior hull and engines. To make matters worse, the force of the impact burst several pipes and now we have hazardous gas spewing into multiple modules. \r\n\r\nThis wouldn\u0027t be an issue if the main shutoff valve wasn\u0027t also damaged by the exterior explosion. We\u0027ll need to do a spacewalk to assess the damage, but we\u0027ve only got so much oxygen left.\r\n\r\nSecond, the supplies. They emptied us out, taking our food and water along with our cargo. There\u0027s nothing left for us to subsist on, and we need the energy to finish the repairs. This is a race against the clock, and my concern is we lack the constitution to run.We all agreed that to repair the exterior, we\u0027ll first need to stop the leaks to get access to the port. \r\n\r\nTo handle this, I directed a strike team to focus on finding and patching leaks in the pipe work. For the smaller leaks, we were able to wrap the pipes in tape and epoxy and let it cure. For some of the larger leaks we used a gasket and clamp approach, but I don\u0027t have an estimate on how long it\u0027ll hold. \r\n\r\nThese measures are designed to be short term fixes, but it should buy us enough time to do the exterior hull work. It will be dangerous for whoever goes out there, because of the orbiting debris. The crew is talking about drawing straws, which I agreed was the fairest way. I pray this is the right choice.We lost Gutierrez during the exterior repair, may his soul rest in peace. \r\n\r\nHe had almost shut off the main valve before he was hit with some floating debris. The piece ripped through his suit; he lost consciousness and died shortly after. \r\n\r\nWe managed to recover the body, but now some of the others are talking about doing the unthinkable. Fatigue and hunger are settling in, and hard choices need to be made. But my faith tells me this is not the way.\r\n\r\nStill, I cannot speak for my crew. Each individual member will have to make their own peace with their decision. Whether they choose to partake or abstain, I understand it\u0027s a sacrifice for the crew as a whole.The crew members who consumed Gutierrez\u0027s body have all fallen ill. Call it divine retribution, or just rotten luck, but none of them were able to hold the meal down. Now we\u0027re down to half a crew trying to get this engine functional. \r\n\r\nOn top of that, the leaks are getting worse, but it seems at this point we\u0027ve decided to just put all our eggs into repairing the engines and deal with the gas after. \r\n\r\nBlessed father, I\u0027m still haunted by that pirate attack. I keep replaying the moment when they hailed us. If only I ran the scan first, and jumped to safety. If only I had been more skeptical, none of this would have come to pass. I know this is merely a test, and part of his plan. But why do I feel like I have failed him?\r\n\r\n"

His knowledge of the ship\u0027s maintenance borders on encyclopedic. He has the capability to work and think under pressure, which has saved the Legacy on numerous occasions. \r\n\r\nEven as a valued member of the crew, I must log my concerns regarding his alcohol abuse issues. When off-duty, Osterholt is often found in the mess area in a mild state of inebriation. Though it hasn\u0027t jeopardized the crew or the ship, and no one has lodged a formal complaint, it remains a potential problem that should be monitored.Crew Evaluation\r\n\r\nD. Mayfield - Ship\u0027s Medic, (GPF-09921)\r\n\r\nCrewman Mayfield is an exemplary medic and an asset to the Legacy. He\u0027s friendly, approachable and discrete (though he informs me if an injury or a symptom could affect the crew as a whole). He works well under pressure and does an excellent job monitoring the physical and mental health of the crew.\r\n\r\nI\u0027d like to recommend that Crewman Mayfield be promoted to the Legacy\u0027s First Mate to replace the vacancy left by Obidiah Meers, who was killed in last year\u0027s pirate attack. I will file the proper paperwork when I arrive at our home port.Crew Evaluation\r\n\r\nL. Aguilar - Ship\u0027s Crewman, (GPF-09942)\r\n\r\nCrewman Aguilar is a remarkable member of the Legacy\u0027s crew. She is one of the toughest and bravest long-haulers that I\u0027ve had the pleasure of flying with. She has an uncanny knack for quickly handling any problem or situation that\u0027s placed in her path. \r\n\r\nThe only issue I can see with Aguilar is her short temper. Some of the more abrasive members of the crew can often get under her skin, which has triggered arguments and minor altercations. If she could conquer this issue, I would gladly recommend her for the Command Training Program once her initial tour is complete.\r\n\r\nCrew Evaluation\r\n\r\nT. Kellner - Ship\u0027s Crewman, (GPF-09977)\r\n\r\nCrewman Kellner is a valued member of the crew. He does his job as expected, follows orders properly and is dependable under pressure. Though his specialty is the ship\u0027s defensive systems, I\u0027ve seen him jump into other roles without complaint. Overall, he gets along with everyone, and I am pleased to have him aboard.\r\n\r\nThat being said, I\u0027d like to formally report I have engaged in a consensual relationship with Crewman Kellner. I realize this jeopardizes my position as Captain of the Legacy, and I will face whatever disciplinary action that administration feels is necessary. Since this could have an effect on both of our careers, I\u0027d like to request that Crewman Kellner be transferred when our current assignment is complete.Crew Evaluation\r\n\r\nB. Baccara - Ship\u0027s Crewman, (GPF-09979)\r\n\r\nCrewman Baccara is a problematic member of the crew. Though he performs his role as expected, he\u0027s combative, insolent and often challenges my commands in front of the crew. Though I am aware we are not a military vessel, I still expect a certain amount of decorum from everyone under my command.\r\n\r\nCrewman Baccara is a detriment to the Legacy and its crew. I\u0027d like to request he be transferred to another location within the company after our current mission is complete.Crew Evaluation\r\n\r\nC. Simmons - Ship\u0027s Crewman, (GPF-10017)\r\n\r\nCrewman Simmons is undergoing her one-year trainee evaluation. So far, she\u0027s shown ample aptitude for all of the assignments she\u0027s been given. Though her task load is light, she often finds herself second-guessing her own work, which in turn results in extended duty time. I\u0027ve repeatedly reminded her that she needs to have more self-confidence regarding her duties, and I am hoping she\u0027ll take that advice to heart.\r\n\r\nI will transmit my final evaluation to the personnel division when we arrive at our home port."

I hate to pull rank given I know he means well, but we don\u0027t need another cook in the kitchen.We knew the risks going in, but getting this data was important. And now that we have it, Dr. Suruki wants us to dock at a Freestar starstation as if we didn\u0027t just steal their milk money.\r\n\r\nHe does have a point though. The math isn\u0027t in our favor. Common sense tells me I should nuke the data we stole, put everything into the engines, and slow crawl this ship to the nearest starstation. \r\n\r\nBut I also know how valuable this data could be to MAST. On top of that, the FC\u0027s data recovery team might start poking around our systems -- flight patterns, deleted data, military crew -- and piece together a story we don\u0027t want them telling. So I don\u0027t want to make that call just yet.I hate to admit but the mission is a failure. Our engineers are dropping like flies, and I can\u0027t help but think I\u0027m the one to blame.\r\n\r\nI\u0027ve wiped the intel we stole and set course for the nearest starstation.

This is to monitor the creature\u0027s health and look for any abnormal changes due to space flight. Any life-threatening situations will require scientist approval before intervention.\r\n\r\nFeeding schedule\r\n=========================\r\nThe creature will subsist on a predetermined diet approved by the nutritionist back at the facility. Stool samples will be collected and analyzed daily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter three days in confinement, Species X-34c has enveloped itself in some sort of cocoon. \r\n\r\nThe team believes this is due to stress factors. There was some suggestion that the creature was originally in a larval state, but this behavior has not been witnessed at the land facility, nor in its natural habitat. After three days without change, the cocoon began to disburse spores. The exposure hit several doctors and members of the crew before it was contained.\r\n\r\nThankfully, preliminary analysis of the spores shows they are non-toxic. As for what the spores are, comparison with membranes of known species show no correlation. Proteins and enzyme analysis has come up inconclusive.  \r\n\r\nWe\u0027d like to do more extensive laboratory testing in the coming days, but the cocoon is once again dormant. X-ray and ultrasound data show the creature is still hibernating peacefully inside. This may have been a reaction to stimuli, or just part of the hibernation phase. We\u0027re not sure.\r\n\r\nWe don\u0027t have much choice other than to sit on our hands and wait for something to happen again.The cocoon is going through another metamorphosis. \r\n\r\nWe are seeing evidence of some kind of cloning process happening inside. Similar to mitosis seen on the cellular level, the creature appears to be making a copy of itself through a process we don\u0027t fully understand. \r\n\r\nWe\u0027ve seen asexual reproduction in many species and bacteria, using binary fission, budding, fragmentation, or parthenogenesis. There is some debate over whether this reaction was triggered by our experimentation, or if it\u0027s part of the creature\u0027s natural cycle we simply have not observed previously.\r\n\r\nThis will require further study beyond the two weeks we have for this experiment. Moreover, we are understaffed and dealing with several issues on the ship. Members of both the crew and the science team have reported increased sluggishness and mental fatigue, and productivity as a whole has reached a standstill. \r\n\r\nI am putting in a request to return to the facility immediately, but so far have not gotten a response from leadership."

Wanyan - GENSEC Level 02\r\nExperiment Report EXP-GDY072-002\r\n\r\nMy second attempt to adapt the Conduction Grid technology to a spaceship\u0027s shield array has failed. There are two main issues. First, the experimental Grid draws power from the reactor, which is the opposite of what we want. For this to be a success, the Grid needs to become fully self-sustaining when exposed to EM damage. Second, the insulating circuits that were utilized in Neon\u0027s Grid are far too bulky to install in a shipborne module.\r\n\r\nMy only choice at this point is to deal with the issues one at a time, as my resources down here are quite limited, and Chief Technician Bayu\u0027s \u0022advice\u0022 continues to prove worthless.Technician L. Wanyan - GENSEC Level 02\r\nExperiment Report EXP-GDY072-006\r\n\r\nAfter months of trial and error, I\u0027ve discovered an alloy that might provide the perfect balance of conductivity and insulation that\u0027s required for the experiment to succeed. The problem is that the alloy consists of rare metals that we don\u0027t have on hand.\r\n\r\nI\u0027m on the verge of a breakthrough, but Chief Technician Bayu insists that he has \u0022better ideas in the works\u0022 and refuses to pay for the raw materials that I need.

Wanyan - GENSEC Level 02\r\nExperiment Report EXP-GDY072-011\r\n\r\nAfter halting the insulation solution, I\u0027ve turned my attention to the power drain issue. Using the lab\u0027s EM emitter, I have subjected GDY072\u0027s Grid to a wide array of impact simulations. From my observations, the Grid remains self-sustaining for a short period of time, but reaches a falloff point where it needs to draw power from the ship\u0027s reactor.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, this mysterious falloff point seems to coincide with a temperature spike in the lateral array. Since the array we set up in the lab simulation is outdated, I\u0027ve put in a request to purchase a new one from Stroud-Eklund. It\u0027s my hope that the updated array will not suffer from the same issue. Technician L. Wanyan - GENSEC Level 02\r\nExperiment Report EXP-GDY072-020\r\n\r\nThis will be the last entry for the GDY072 Grid. I have hit a solid wall in the experiment and can\u0027t progress beyond this point. My knowledge of astronautics and ship systems is decent, but for the experiment to be a success, we need people with a high degree of expertise in those fields. Every request I\u0027ve made to that extent has been denied or ignored.\r\n\r\nI am therefore terminating this experiment until another technician wishes to take over or Chief Technician Bayu resigns, and we get someone who actually knows what they\u0027re doing in this place."

Wild cards.\r\nAce of Spades - Light work. Big pay.\r\nKing of Hearts - Any high risk, high reward job. Suicide king for suicidal work.That was a close one. New Atlantis must\u0027ve beefed up their scanner tech, and flagged our transport for boarding. Luckily we were able to nuke the contraband before security got their hands on it, but the client wasn\u0027t happy. We got away with the ship and our freedom, but we owe.\r\n\r\nI told the crew they all have to pony up some of their wages to pay for the new shields. They grumbled, as expected, but they all know the deal. No shields, no jobs.I\u0027ve been working the spacelanes for years, and I\u0027ve survived this long by having a strict set of rules. \r\n\r\nThe biggest being, never take a job if you don\u0027t know the risks. That\u0027s like betting your last cred on a gut-shot straight draw. And yet here I am, doing just that. It\u0027s a sick way to go out, but those are the terms.\r\n\r\nOur cred flow had just about run dry when I got word of a big score from one of my old gang contacts. We meet the client at Euphorika. He doesn\u0027t give me a name, or any of the usual small talk. Fine, I hate small talk. He just wants to know the class of my ship, and the size of my cargo hold. I give him the data, and I tell him if it\u0027s not enough, we\u0027ll make room.\r\n\r\nSatisfied, the client tells me he wants me to pick up a package in the Moloch system, and deliver it to Vectera. He hands me the coordinates for both the pick up and the drop on a piece of paper. Doesn\u0027t give any other details. Just removes himself from the scene. \r\n\r\nI tell my first mate about the job, and he tells me to turn it down. Things get heated, and I have to pull rank. But he\u0027s right about one thing.

But at this point, it\u0027s the only play.It took a while, but we finally loaded the cargo from Moloch I. The coordinates were exactly right, so it\u0027s a good thing we landed the bird twenty paces south of that.\r\n\r\nZhang and Mason got the cargo into the hold, with a few bumps and bruises along the way. It was always gonna be a tight fit, but Zhang\u0027s a savant with this stuff. She\u0027s like the Alyssa Demille of cargo packing. \r\n\r\nAnyway, we\u0027ll do a test jump to a nearby system before we make the trip to our final destination.

The machines have flagged the entire crew as hostile, and now every single one of us is a target.\r\n\r\nUsing the intercom, I instructed the crew to stay in their quarters until we can find a way to disable them.

And we haven\u0027t really had time for the standard bonding exercises. Hopefully if we run into any heated situations they will trust my expertise.Like Icarus in the tales, we flew too close to a star. \r\n\r\nOr so the Captain says. Perhaps he would\u0027ve been better served as a poet. The reality is it was a solar storm emitting a huge burst of energy in the form of solar flares and coronal mass ejections. Phenomena like this is not unprecedented, and we should\u0027ve taken it into account in our flight trajectory. \r\n\r\nUltimately, the massive stream of electrical charges overwhelmed our shields and damaged our engines. In fact, none of our systems are functioning reliably, and are venting excess heat into the ship. As the medical officer on this ship, I worry about dehydration and heat exhaustion for the crew. As a former engineer, I wonder what further damage the heat is doing to our already compromised systems. \r\n\r\nWe need to dock somewhere, and soon.I\u0027ve explained to the Captain the issue with our shields. \r\n\r\nThe problem isn\u0027t the heat inside the spaceship, albeit most would agree it\u0027s unbearable. The primary issue is re-entry.\r\n\r\nMoving at a speed of 50,000 kilometers per hour, the friction of the atmosphere will generate heat around the ship of approximately 2700 degrees Celsius. The craft\u0027s backup thermal shields will not hold up under that kind of stress.\r\n\r\nWith the grav drive disabled, I suggested traveling to a nearby Freestar station, which would take us about three weeks. However, the Captain has refused, for reasons that are classified.It took half our crew collapsing, but the Captain has finally agreed to dock at the Freestar starstation.\r\n\r\nWe\u0027ve already lost a week\u0027s time. I pray that we\u0027re not too late.\r\n"

Peter\u0027s the only person here who doesn\u0027t treat me like a nail.\r\n\r\nThere\u0027s been rumors about a mutiny, and I know it\u0027s only a matter of time before it actually happens. Thybulle has gotten Swift and Ibanez on his side, but how?\r\n\r\nThose two may not respect me, but they hate Thybulle. And it hurts to say, but I\u0027m also hearing rumors about something on the ship\u0027s medical records. Has Dr. Guentzel betrayed me too?

He tried to defend me and they just killed him in cold blood.\r\n\r\nAfter they stole the ship medical records, Thybulle accused me of poisoning Captain Oswalt. It turns out Peter had nothing to do with it, because he had my back the whole way. According to him, the records were tampered with. But not only did the crew refuse to listen, they made sure to silence him, and me.\r\n\r\nI know I\u0027m not making it out of this. I have no MedPacks, and this wound isn\u0027t going to heal. But if they think I\u0027m helpless, they\u0027re wrong. I\u0027m going to remove the combat inhibitors on the robot crew. Nobody\u0027s leaving this ship alive."

    "bookText": "Hey there, friend.\r\n\r\nYou stand now in Akila City, capital of the Freestar Collective, and symbol of hope and freedom for every soul in the Settled Systems.\r\n\r\nIn the year 2167, intrepid trailblazer Solomon Coe claimed and named the Cheyenne star system. He then set his boots down on this very planet, which he named Akila. And although he was but a single man, Solomon Coe named his new settlement Akila City - because he knew that someday his dream would come true, and his tiny outpost would one day grow into the thriving frontier town it is today.\r\n\r\nAll we ask is that you treat everyone you meet in Akila City the way you\u0027d want to be treated yourself: with respect, kindness, good cheer. Our trained security officers are here for your protection, but it\u0027s protection you\u0027ll seldom need. \r\n\r\nWe do ask everyone in Akila City, be it visitor or resident, to stay within the settlement\u0027s walls. The Ashta roam freely on the other side, and will view any human being as prey. Freedom.\r\n\r\nThroughout the course of recorded history, that word has meant so many things to so many people. For Solomon Coe, true understanding of the concept came in the year 2161, when the newly-formed United Colonies issued the Centaurus Proclamation, thereby formalizing the colonization of any star system in our galaxy. That was the moment Solomon Coe knew that his destiny lay elsewhere. In order to free himself, both body and spirit, he would need to heed his wanderlust and venture alone into the stars. And so he did.\r\n\r\nSadly, the United Colonies commitment to the very freedom they projected was short lived. As Solomon Coe expanded upon his dream, and invited other star systems to join him in what he called the Freestar Collective, United Colonies leadership revealed their true colors. Exploration was seen as aggression. Freedom, as defiance.\r\n\r\nWhat followed were two bloody conflicts - the Narion War and Colony War. In both, the United Colonies tried to erase Akila City, and indeed the entire Freestar Collective, from the face of the Settled Systems. They claimed they were defending their borders. Outer space is infinite, and yet they wanted our own. Why? Because the very thought of freedom, to those who wish only to control, is unacceptable.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, here you stand. In Akila City, proud capital of the Freestar Collective. Freedom is hard earned. Freedom is hard fought. But freedom is always worth it.\r\n\r\nWhether you live in Akila City or are just visiting, you\u0027ll find every business imaginable, from small independent stores to the larger retailers known throughout the Settled Systems.\r\n\r\nThe following is a list of some of the businesses you\u0027ll find here in Akila City.\r\n\r\nMidtown\r\n\r\n- Rowland Arms\r\n- The Hitching Post\r\n- Shepherd\u0027s General Store\r\n- Midtown Minerals\r\n- Stoneroot Inn\r\n- Laredo Firearms\r\n- Chunks\r\n- Sinclair\u0027s Books\r\n- TerraBrew\r\n\r\nThe Stretch\r\n\r\n- Aggie\u0027s\r\n\r\n\t\r\nIn additional to our fine stores, Akila City also has many other locations that may be of interest, either for their historical significance or services they may offer.\r\n\r\nThe Core\r\n\r\n- The Rock\r\n- Coe Estate\r\n- Memorial\r\n\r\nMidtown\r\n\r\n- Spaceport\r\n- GalBank\r\n- Sanctum Universum\r\n- House of the Enlightened\r\n\r\nThe Stretch\r\n\r\n- Honest Earl\u0027s Alien Extravaganza\r\n- Trade AuthorityJust as the Freestar Collective stands as a symbol of freedom for the Settled Systems, so too do the Freestar Rangers serve as a symbol of freedom for the Freestar Collective itself.\r\n\r\nFounded in the year 2231, the Rangers are the protectors of the people and ideals of the Freestar Collective. It\u0027s not enough to call them police, and too much to consider them soldiers. Rather, the Rangers are guardians - YOUR guardians - and they\u0027ve dedicated their lives to the service of the Freestar Collective.\r\n\r\nBut don\u0027t take our word for it.\r\n\r\nThe Rangers welcome all inside the Rock, which serves not only as their headquarters, but as Akila City\u0027s primary meeting place and watering hole. There you can meet the members of this elite organization, and learn firsthand how committed this small, dedicated force is to the ideals first shared by Solomon Coe himself."

Just goes to show how high the stakes are.\r\n\r\nI\u0027ve been debating how to handle it. I don\u0027t want to go to Dr. Showalter, not yet. Seems like a conversation with Clarence is in order, but I\u0027m not sure how receptive he\u0027ll be.Decided to go back to our existing retail fleet and play around with some existing components. We\u0027re \u0022all Grav Drive all the time\u0022 these days, but a Graviton Loop array isn\u0027t going to help a ship fight off marauders, or make a hard turn when you\u0027re approaching a starstation docking port too fast.\r\n\r\nOur Nimitz class may get all the attention (big\u002Bguns = fun yeah yeah I get it) but for me, there\u0027s always been something about the Discovery class. Its function may officially be exploration, but one look, and you know what I see? Adventure.\r\n\r\nI\u0027ve been making some modifications to the Engines. In my spare time, for fun. My gut\u0027s just telling me the Discovery class could be JUST a little bit zippier...The Graviton Loop Array is too big. \r\n\r\nThat\u0027s stating the obvious. You just need to look at the prototype ship to see how impractically large it is. We all know it. Problem is, it\u0027s not too big - not to get the ship from the Moon to Jupiter. \r\n\r\nBut what about after that? One and done? That\u0027s it? Of course not.\r\n\r\nThroughout the history of technological advancement, there has been a reliable constant - miniaturization. As engineering gets better, technology gets smaller. Microchips, cars, televisions, etc. etc. etc. \r\n\r\nSo it stands to reason we\u0027ll get our Grav Drives smaller. I\u0027d just like them to get smaller faster. \r\n\r\nWe\u0027re changing the nature of humanity. The stars are within reach... and people are going to want to reach them. So the sooner we can fit our ships with grav drives, the better off Nova Galactic will be. And, let\u0027s be honest - the better off the human race will be.\r\n\r\nWe don\u0027t know what\u0027s out there. But we\u0027ve got to help people find out. \r\nSpoke to Clarence. It went surprisingly well. He said it wasn\u0027t his intention at all to take credit for my work, and that he was simply reporting on the team\u0027s progress. The more we talked, the more he admitted he hadn\u0027t really seen things from my perspective. I smiled, nodded, and listened... and assumed it was all bullshit.\r\n\r\nI was pleasantly surprised two days later during our meeting with Dr. Showalter. Clarence gave me credit for spearheading the team\u0027s discoveries, and after that, Dr. Showalter directed most of his questions to me.\r\n\r\nThat was two weeks ago. Since then, Clarence and I have worked pretty closely together. We\u0027ve talked a lot, and even had a couple of arguments, but throoughout it all the mutual respect has remained.\r\n\r\nNever expected to make a friend up here, but Clarence is good people. I talked to Julia, and she agrees - time to add him to the wedding guest list."

    "bookText": "After meeting with Aisiha Hunter and Clarence Clarke, I have decided to approve the formation of a new working group dedicated to decreasing the size of the Graviton Loop Array.\r\n\r\nWhile it\u0027s true the current grav drive fits onto the prototype starship, reaching that milestone has required considerable, and repeated, redesign and construction. It was a sound plan, and we are incredibly close to making the first successful grav jump. \r\n\r\nHowever, the current (large) size of the Grav Drive is impractical for a number of reasons, and it behooves us to design a more compact version that could be used with a standard starship chassis.It\u0027s hard to say what our normal day-to-day will be like after the prototype\u0027s first jump, or how many subsequent jumps will be necesssary, but current estimates are that Nova Galactic will completely transition back to standard commercial design and production within two years. \r\n\r\nWhen that happens, we MUST offer consumers Graviton Loop Array-capable ships. We MUST be the first to do so. With a discovery this significant, it will only be a matter of time before other individuals, companies or manufacturers find ways around our patents and begin producing their own jump-capable ships.\r\n\r\nOf course, it\u0027s hard to say what this will ultimately mean for the future of humanity. But progress is inevitable, and it\u0027s incredible to imagine Nova Galactic as being at the forefront of what can only be considered an evolutionary leap.After discussing with the board of directors, we\u0027ve decided to move forward on the patent for the NOVACS, or Nova Connection System.\r\n\r\nWhile work on the connector actually pre-dates our current project, it was because of the design and construction of the Grav Drive ship that we actually began to make significant advancements. \r\n\r\nEssentially, the NOVACS is a universal connector for any and all ship modules, regardless of class. Imagine, a Grav Drive-fitted starship of any shape or design, whose function is limited only by its connected modules. The possibilities would be nearly limitless.\r\n\r\nHence, the patent. After the introduction of the Graviton Loop Array, its easy to imagine a kind of \u0022starship manufacturing gold rush,\u0022 with who knows how many companies emerging to stake their claim. \r\n\r\nAnd while we may not be able to wholly own Grav Drive technology, and the dreams that come with it, we can absolutely own and enforce the NOVACS patent, thereby forcing any future ship manufacturers to pay Nova Galactic for its use.\r\n\r\nDespite the proprietary work currently being done, Nova Galactic continues to maintain its stock of starships. As always, we offer several different classes for several different customer types and budgets. \r\n\r\nBut, after meeting with Clarence and Aisiha, I agree with their findings. We need to expect - and plan for - either a.) a decrease in standard ship production OR b.) retrofitting existing ship classes with the Graviton Loop Array.\r\n\r\nThe following is Aisha\u0027s proposal for updated ship classes, and their roles - each fitted with a Graviton Loop Array (i.e.Grav Drive):\r\n\r\n- Discovery - Exploration\r\n- Endeavor - Deep-Range Exploration\r\n- Econohaul - Cargo\r\n- Ranger - Medium-Range Multi-Role\r\n- Mayflower - Long-Range Colony\r\n- Blackhawk - Medium-Range Multi-Role\r\n- Mustang - Short-Range System Defense\r\n- Spitfire - Short-Range Heavy System Defense\r\n- Kfir - Long-Range Fighter\r\n- Spirit - Long-Range Destroyer\r\n- Constitution - Medium-Range Cruiser\r\n- Zumwalt - Long-Range Destroyer\r\n- Bismark - Medium-Range Battleship\r\n- Yamato - Long-Range Battleship\r\n- Kirov - Medium-Range Cruiser\r\n- Nimitz - Medium-Range Heavy Cruiser"

According to what I\u0027m reading, it looks like you\u0027ve conjecturized that Kendley had a drinking problem and was last seen in a drunken state near one of the main airlocks. Three minutes after the sighting, the airlock triggered, depressurized section 7A and then Kendley was unfortunately sucked out into space. If this sounds accurate, we\u0027ll continue our investigation from here. If any new information surfaces regarding the incident, keep us informed.Trident Com ICC-8723A\r\nFrom: Trident Corporate\r\n\r\nCaptain, could you please confirm and advise on the following missing items from VOY-765? According to our dock master at the arrival port, these did not arrive as expected.\r\n\r\n- 10 Crates of Precious Metals \r\n- 15 Crates of Wine/Liquor\r\n- 10 Crates of Synthetic Cloth\r\n- 20 Crates of Furnishings\r\n\r\nOnce you fill out the incident report, we\u0027ll start investigating. Probably just a miscount at the origin end of the voyage but doesn\u0027t hurt to keep things safe.Trident Com ICC-8902A\r\nFrom: Trident Corporate\r\n\r\nCaptain, please be aware that the Terran Preservation Society will be booking the Siren\u0027s next voyage and they require full use of the Starview Ballroom. Extend every courtesy to their people and ensure that their event goes exactly as planned. This is a significant client, and we don\u0027t want to risk losing this account. We\u0027ll send specific details in the future.Trident Com ICC-9085A\r\nFrom: Trident Corporate\r\n\r\nCaptain, we are still awaiting answers to our inquiry regarding the Siren of the Stars\u0027s last three voyages. On every occasion, the ship\u0027s cargo was several thousand kilos lighter at the arrival port. Simply chalking these up to \u0022human error\u0022 is unacceptable. May I remind you that the missing cargo holds a substantial dollar value that we\u0027re responsible to cover due to loss? If we don\u0027t have a proper report from you by the end of the month, we will be forced to launch a full investigation."

Between you and me, the only way you\u0027re going to get him to change his mind is by giving us something we can sink our teeth into... something big.

The big guy doesn\u0027t want to budge on this one, so you need to light a fire under his ass. You need a big score. Huge.

Going to keep this one kind of quiet or else everyone will want a piece. If this works out, I\u0027m almost positive the big guy will change his mind about you. Might cost you a chunk of change, but you want back in so you can play the long game, right?"

    "bookText": "After speaking with Commander Natara, Lieutenant Toft has assured me that Project Svalinn has been fully tested by the engineers at SY-920, and approved by MAST. If everything goes according to plan, we will begin implementation immediately. \r\n\r\nWhen the time comes, this upgrade will be essential for what we have planned.It\u0027s no secret that we\u0027ve had trouble explaining to the officials at MAST the urgency of the Crimson Fleet menace. Despite the fact that they are a disorganized band of pirates, they must be treated as a criminal organization that poses a threat to the safety of the Settled Systems.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, without intel on the inner workings of the Crimson Fleet, much of this is speculation. We need someone on the inside to help us fill in the blanks. This is why I\u0027ve requested the records of every prisoner detained by the United Colonies. Surely there is a candidate among them who will suit our needs.There are years where nothing happens, and years that can define a life. I was sixteen when I first took to the skies. Seventeen when it all came crashing down.\r\n\r\nIt began with a ship. Earlier that year, my father had salvaged a wreck from the war, a B class Deimos fighter from an abandoned staryard. It was old, outdated, and to put it bluntly, a piece of junk. The controls were shaky, the plating was rusted, and the engine coughed like it had a bad lung. \r\n\r\nBut none of that mattered to me. I was hooked from the very first grav jump. \r\n\r\nYou see, up until that point, I had often struggled to focus. Nothing I did had any long term appeal. That all changed the moment I took that Deimos junker out to the spacelanes. For the first time in my life, I could see a life for me beyond the present. This ship, for all its loose wires, dents, and pockmarks, gave me purpose. Something I could devote my life to.\r\n\r\nThree months later I was an escort for my father\u0027s freighter. \r\n\r\nTen months later, we were attacked by the Crimson Fleet.\r\n\r\nMost days, I think about my father -- the kind, gentle man who raised me. I think about how much poorer this galaxy is without his laughter soaring through its membrane. And other times, my thoughts turn to his son, the boy with the star-bright eyes, and the future he lost. \r\n\r\nWhen I am confronted by this boy. my resolve begins to wane. I want him to forgive me for the man I\u0027ve become, one consumed by hate and vengeance. I stand wordless as he tugs at the corners of my jacket, tears flowing down his cheeks, begging me to let my anger go. And in that moment, every part of me wants to embrace him, and tell him exactly what he needs to hear. I want to tell him I will drop this accursed chase, and give his future the chance it deserves.\r\n\r\nBut instead, I turn away. I leave him crying, alone in the void of space. But what he does not realize, is that I am doing this for him. I fight the Crimson Fleet for all the fathers and futures lost to a world that never should have been. And when I think of them, my resolve returns, and I have purpose once more.What is it all for? On the eve of battle, I find myself asking this question now more than ever. \r\n\r\nSo to remind myself, I\u0027ve taken to wandering the halls, listening to soldiers talk idly about their families. I\u0027ve found it\u0027s rejuvenating to hear these small stories about spouses, children, and babies on the way. Then, to contrast, I like to imagine what the Fleet are talking about, there on the Key. \r\n\r\nIn war, sometimes we are asked to suspend our humanity in order to serve it. But our fight requires no such compromise. The Crimson Fleet stand in defiance to what is right and humane. If you don\u0027t believe me, just listen to what they say.I had our courier grav jump to MAST to relay the success of the mission. There was some thought that I would deliver the news myself, but my gut feeling says that would be gauche. No one likes an \u0022I told you so,\u0022 least of all those in charge.\r\n\r\nBesides, there is only one soul I would like to tell in person, and when my time comes, I will deliver the news with tears in my eyes.\r\n\r\nFor this is a joyous day, and yet, not what I expected. All in all, I knew I would be happy. But strangely, I don\u0027t feel relief? My original plan was to retire when this mission was over, but this battle has invigorated me. \r\n\r\nI\u0027m afraid that boy with the star-bright eyes will have to wait a little longer."
